# Service Type Optimization - Complete Implementation

## MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. ELIMINATED SERVICE DUPLICATIONS
**Before**: 16 services with massive overlaps (China Sourcing + Sourcing Services had identical 47 subreddits)
**After**: 11 specialized services with no duplications

### 2. IMPLEMENTED ADAPTIVE SCORING THRESHOLDS
**Before**: All services used 60+ score threshold (manufacturing bias)
**After**: Service-specific thresholds:
- Manufacturing & Sourcing: 60+ (high-value deals)
- Digital Marketing: 40+ (volume-based)
- Social Media Posting: 30+ (creative services)
- Video Editing: 35+ (project-based)
- Drone Services: 35+ (specialized equipment)

### 3. SPECIALIZED SUBREDDIT TARGETING
**Before**: Generic business subreddits for most services
**After**: Highly targeted communities per service type:
- Social Media: 15 specialized communities (InstagramGrowth, TikTokCreators, etc.)
- Video Editing: 13 production-focused communities (premiere, aftereffects, etc.)
- Manufacturing: 14 engineering/production communities
- Drone Services: 16 commercial aviation communities

### 4. ENHANCED SEARCH INTELLIGENCE
**Before**: Generic search terms like "need help"
**After**: High-intent, service-specific terms:
- Manufacturing: "production partner", "manufacturing quote", "factory partnership"
- Social Media: "content creation help", "social media burnout", "posting consistency"
- Drones: "commercial drone services", "part 107 commercial", "drone fleet management"

### 5. URGENCY & BUDGET DETECTION
**NEW FEATURE**: Service-specific urgency and budget pattern detection
- Urgency boosts: +15 points max for time-sensitive projects
- Budget boosts: +12 points max for clear budget indicators
- Examples:
  - "urgent video editing" → +5 urgency points
  - "manufacturing budget allocated" → +4 budget points
