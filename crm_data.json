      "title": "I closed 200+ freelance deals with this script",
      "content": "I always thought I sucked at sales.\n\nGot my first job as a telemarketer when I was 16, and I quit 6 hours into my first shift.\n\nIt was emotionally exhausting and I honestly felt disgusted.\n\nThis experience scarred me for years and held me back when I started building my freelancing business 8 years later.\n\nThen I joined an absurdly expensive mastermind ($7500 / 3 months) where they shared the initial version of the script I'm about to share with you.\n\nAnd it flipped my entire mindset about what it takes to sell on its head.\n\nInstead of being salesy, they told me to act like a doctor. Diagnose and then confidently present the cure.\n\nAfter I started doing this, I closed 200+ deals for my freelancing business. From big tech companies all the way down to small mom-and-pop online stores.\n\nHere's the script that changed everything for me:\n\n# The mindset\n\nBefore we get into the \"what to say,\" we need to fix the \"how to think.\" This is 90% of the battle.\n\n* Your job isn't to push a product; it's to diagnose a problem. You should be listening, asking intelligent questions, and determining **if you're even the right person to help them**. If a doctor listened to your symptoms for 30 seconds and immediately tried to sell you on a specific surgery, you'd run. Don't be that person.\n* In the first half of the call, the client should be doing 80% of the talking. If you're talking more than them, you're pitching, not discovering. You're losing.\n* You don't\u00a0need\u00a0this client. You are evaluating\u00a0them\u00a0just as much as they are evaluating you. Think of it like a first date. You're not trying to force a second date from the moment you sit down. You're genuinely trying to see if there's a connection and if you're compatible for a long-term relationship.\n* Do not read this word-for-word. Reading makes you sound like a robot and breaks all trust.\n\n# Preparation\n\nGood prep is going to be the source of your confidence. Knowing your questions and your offer ahead of time frees up your mental energy to actively listen.\n\n1. Go through the steps below and write down 3-5 specific questions for each section.\n2. **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Prepare 1-3 clear service packages with prices**. Even if you won\u2019t be able to pitch a productized service, this will help you quickly and without hesitation answer ANY questions regarding your pricing (e.g. \"I've done similar projects for around $4.000). This makes you look like someone who\u2019s been doing this for years, is a professional and even **allows you to close the deal on the call** instead of letting the momentum die with a \"let me get back to you with a proposal.\"\n\n**The biggest mistake most people make is to NOT talk about pricing.**\n\nTalking about pricing massively speeds up the sales process, because prospects can either accept your offer immediately, decline it, or try a delay tactic.\n\nIf they accept - then great!\n\nIf they decline or delay, you can ASK them why, and you\u2019ll find out a lot about the objections they have about working with you.\n\n# The warm-up\n\nSpending 2-3 minutes on small talk shows you\u2019re a relaxed, normal person, which helps the prospect relax, too.\n\n* What to Say:\n   * \u201cI see you're based in Austin. I've heard great things about the food scene there.\u201d\n   * \u201cI have to mention this, you picked the best Zoom background.\u201d\n   * \u201cGlad we could connect before the weekend. Any exciting plans?\u201d\n\nThen, transition and set the frame. This is crucial for taking control.\n\n* \"Awesome! Well, I\u2019m excited to chat. Should we dive right in?\"\u00a0(Wait for \"yes\")\n* \"Great. So the way I usually run these calls is I'll start by asking a few questions to get a really clear picture of your business and what you're looking for. If it sounds like I can definitely help, I\u2019ll explain how I work. Sound good?\"\n\n# Discovery\n\nThis is your \"doctor\" phase. Start broad and then go deep.\n\n* **If they reached out to you:**\u00a0\"So, to start, I\u2019d love to hear what prompted you to book this call today? What\u2019s going on in your business?\"\n* **If you reached out to them:**\u00a0\"When I reached out, something in my message must have clicked. What was it that made you decide to take this call?\"\n\nNow, shut up and listen. Take notes. After their initial answer, dig deeper with your prepared, service-specific questions.\n\n* **Pro-Tip:**\u00a0If they give short, unhelpful answers, use this:\u00a0**\"Could you tell me a bit more about that?\"**\n\n# Their experience\n\nAre you talking to a seasoned pro or a total beginner? The answer dictates how you'll pitch later on and what kind of questions to ask.\n\n* \"Have you tackled this issue before? What worked or didn\u2019t work?\"\n* \"Have you worked with another freelancer or agency on this? What was that like?\"\n\nThis tells you what they value, what they hate, and what landmines to avoid. If they say their last designer was a \"terrible communicator,\" you know to highlight your communication process in your pitch.\n\nOn the other hand if they tell you they've had 20 freelancers on this and that they all sucked, you should probably run away.\n\n# Defining success\n\nThis is where you move from their\u00a0problems\u00a0to their\u00a0aspirations.\n\n* \"Okay, let's fast forward 6 months. If we were to work together on this, what would need to have happened for you to feel like this was a huge success?\"\n* \"What would achieving \\[their goal\\] actually do for your business? Why is this a priority right now?\"\n\nWhen they answer this, they are literally selling\u00a0themselves\u00a0on the value of your service. Write down their exact words.\n\n# Uncovering roadblocks\n\nWhy their problem still exists. This is the bridge to your pitch.\n\n* \"So you\u2019re looking to achieve \\[their goal\\]. What\u2019s held you back from getting this done on your own so far?\"\n* \"Why do you think you haven't found the right person to help with this yet?\"\n\nTheir answer here is pure gold. It gives you the exact angle for your pitch.\n\n* If they say \"I don't have the time,\" your solution is about a hands-off, \"done-for-you\" process.\n* If they say \"I don't have the expertise,\" your solution is about your deep knowledge and strategic guidance.\n\n# The pitch\n\nSee how late this comes? You should only pitch after you fully understand their situation.\n\n* **Ask for permission:** \"Okay, based on everything you've told me, I have a very clear picture of the situation. I'm confident I can help you achieve \\[Their Goal\\]. Would it be okay if I walk you through how I'd approach it?\"\n* **Frame it:**\u00a0\"Great. So I specialize in helping \\[businesses like them\\] to \\[achieve the exact goal they just told you\\].\"\n* **Show proof:**\u00a0\"For example, last quarter I worked with \\[Similar Client\\], who was struggling with \\[Similar Problem\\]. We implemented this process and they were able to \\[Achieve Result\\].\"\n* **Explain the process:**\u00a0Walk them through the steps.\n   * \"First, we\u2019d start with a kickoff session to...\"\n   * \"Next, I\u2019ll prepare xyz to...\"\n   * \"Finally, you\u2019ll get...\"\n\n**IMPORTANT:** DO NOT REVEAL YOUR PRICING OR PACKAGES AT THIS POINT! Focus solely on the workflow and deliverables.\n\nAfter you're done, ask them:\n\n*  \"That\u2019s the general overview. What questions do you have about that for me?\"\n\nWhen they run out of process questions, they will almost always ask the big one: \"So... how much does it cost?\" This is the moment you've been waiting for.\n\n* \"The cost for the package I just described is $7,500.\"\n\nState your price clearly and confidently. Then, the most important part:\n\n**BE SILENT.**\n\nDo not justify it. Do not explain it. Do not say \"but we can be flexible.\" The first person who talks, loses. Let them react. Their reaction tells you everything you need to know.\n\n# Handling objections\n\nAn objection is not a \"no.\" It's a request for more information or reassurance. Don't get defensive. You can't handle an objection if you don't know what they're thinking. So your first job is to figure out what they're trying to say.\n\n**\"That's more expensive than I was expecting\"**\n\n* \"I understand. Can I ask what you were budgeting for a project like this?\"\u00a0OR\u00a0\"Could you tell me a bit more about what makes it feel expensive?\"\u00a0(This helps you understand if it's a value problem or a cash flow problem).\n\n**\"I need to think about it.\"**\n\n* \"That\u2019s perfectly fine; most of my best clients take time to think. Just so I can understand, what specific part of it do you need to think about most?\"\n\n**\"Why would I pay this much when I can get someone on Fiverr for $500?\"**\n\n* \"That's a fair question. You're right, there are definitely cheaper options out there, and for simple tasks, they can be great. The question is, are you looking to buy a task, or are you looking to buy a business outcome? A task-doer will do exactly what you say. I see my role as a strategic partner to help you achieve \\[their goal\\]. Which of those is more important to you right now?\"\n\n(I've got more objections and how to handle them in the google docs I'm linking below)\n\n# The close\n\nIf they agree with your price and want to move forward, you're not done yet. You need to handle the final step professionally.\n\n* Immediately explain the next steps.\u00a0\"Great! Here\u2019s what will happen next. I'm going to send over the contract and an invoice for the initial deposit. Once that's handled, I'll send you a link to book our kickoff call.\"\n* Don't just hang up after that! Spend 2-3 minutes returning to small talk. This calms their nerves, eases potential buyer's remorse, and reinforces that you're a human they're building a relationship with, not just a vendor who got their money.\n\n# Extra info\n\nI've put some extra objection handling examples, more info, more examples, etc. into a Google Doc which I'm linking in a comment below, to keep this post on point.  \n  \nThis all takes practice to master so I also created a ChatGPT Monster prompt that will roleplay different levels of clients (easy to hard). I'm also including it at the bottom of the doc.  \n",

      "content": "Hey /r/entrepeneur Cory here from Woodies.   **Thanks for the Gold!**\n\nI just read the post about some guy un-subbing because of all the click-bait, shit-posts, so now that he's gone, I thought I'd contribute really helpful content!\n\nWhile making this list, I cannot believe how many freaking services I use, it's kind of ridiculous, I probably need to cancel a few.  \n\nI've been running Woodies for 5 years now, and my vision has become clear.  I want to make as much money as possible while maintaining complete control of my business.  I have no employees, I have no partners.  I'm on track to *hopefully* do a million in revenue this year.\n\nI'm looking for anything that saves me time.  I'm a graduate of the four-hour workweek school of thought and my goal is to outsource everything I can, and automate everything that allows me to multiply my efforts.  \n\nHere is the full list of apps and SaaS that I use to run Woodies:\n\n[***Shopify***](http://shopify.com):  The alpha dog in the ecommerce space\n\n***Shopify Apps***:\n\n***[Login with Amazon](https://apps.shopify.com/login-with-amazon)***:  60% of traffic comes from mobile but only 20% of checkouts, why?  Because it's hard to enter your info, this allows people to login with their Amazon account, choose their address, choose their payment method and boom they're checked out.  Great app\n\n***[Make an Offer](https://apps.shopify.com/make-an-offer)***:  Exit-intent pop-up that allows customers to submit an offer for a product they wanted, they give their email, I use Zapier to shoot them a discount code and to add their email to Mailchimp\n\n***[ShopiMap](https://apps.shopify.com/shopimap)***:  It puts a pin on every customer and shows what they ordered.  Great for social proof.  [Here's mine for Woodies](https://woodies.com/pages/who-wears-woodies)\n\n***[CovetPics](https://apps.shopify.com/covet-pics)***:  Cool Instagram plug-in that makes a collage from my Instagram account and integrates the photos on each product page\n\n[***Yotpo***](http://yotpo.com):  I was lucky to get them while they cost $30/month  now it costs like $300 a month to collect reviews.  It's a really great app though, it auto-sends review requests and displays them on product pages.  I wish they picked a better name, Yotpo is kinda lame\n\n***[Spently](https://apps.shopify.com/spently)***:  I use them for sending out sweet order confirmation emails. The default ones from Shopify are pretty boring, these are awesome, shout to Nick!\n\n***[Compass.Co](http://compass.co)***:  The best ecommerce analytics I've seen, they integrate with all my sales channels and pull in more information than I knew I had and organize it neatly\n\n[***Amazon:***](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/homepage.html)  My number one sales platform, responsible for over 60% of my sales\n\n***Customer Service***:  This is VERY IMPORTANT.  Luckily, I pay my mom a monthly rate to perform this valuable service.  ([*thanks mom!*](https://woodies.com/pages/contact))  Unfortunately, you can't use her!  You CAN use someone else's mom however, the website [HireMyMom](https://www.hiremymom.com/) (queue all the reddit jokes)  We all know mom's are awesome, they're usually consistent, reliable, and friendly.  For VA's, mom's are #1\n\n[***AmazonFBA***](https://services.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon/benefits.htm):  The service that receives, stores, packs, and ships 100% of my products.  Without this service, I wouldn't be able to travel full-time, I'd need to rent a warehouse, hire workers, and the rest\n\n***[Amazon Affiliates](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/welcome)***:  I sell on Shopify and Amazon, but I understand there are people out there who just LOVE Amazon Prime, so they go to my site, find a product they like, then want to buy it Amazon, I don't blame them, I would prefer free shipping also.  SO on each of my product pages, I include a link to my product listing on Amazon, I use an affiliate link so that I make like 1% of the order.  It adds up to only like $100/month, but it's better than nothing.  ***See an example: [Woodies Zebrawood Sunglasses](https://woodies.com/collections/bamboo-wood-sunglasses/products/zebra-wood-aviator-wrap-sunglasses)*** *warning: affiliate link on next page*\n\nAmazon Apps:\n\n[***FeedbackGenius***](https://www.feedbackgenius.com/):  Sends automatic feedback requests to hundreds of orders per day, reviews are so valuable on Amazon that this app pays for itself many times over\n\n***[HelloProfit](http://helloprofit.com)***:  I started realizing how many different services I use and I went in a cancelled this one, $79 a month just to make the reports section of Amazon look better, not worth it\n\nWebsite:  \n\n[***Cloudflare***](https://www.cloudflare.com):  Supposedly makes my website faster, I have no idea honestly how this works, might be wasting $20/month, can anyone chime in here??  \n\n***[Typeform](http://typeform.com)***:  Awesome way to use forms.  I use them to collect information from giveaways.  \n\n***[Zapier](http://zapier.com)***:  Works well with Typeform to transfer data in between services like Gmail - Typeform - GoogleDocs - Mailchimp - Shopify.  Example, customer buys thing, Shopify tells Gmail, Gmail sends Email with Typeform, Shopify tells Mailchimp, Mailchimp adds to segment, Customer fills out Typeform, Typeform tells Mailchimp to send out Gmail, wait what?  It gets complicated\n\n***[GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com)***:  Probably not the best out there, but whatever it works fine, never had a problem\n\nTask Management:\n\n***[Gmail](http://gmail.com)***: I try to only check it twice a day, and my absolute goal is [Inbox Zero](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/inbox-zero)\n\n*Pro-tip*  [Learn all the Gmail keyboard shortcuts](https://www.shortcutworld.com/en/mac/Gmail.html)  \n\n*Pro-tip 2*  Enable Send+Archive in Gmail Settings and set it up to automatically open your next email\n\n[***Inbox Pause***](http://inboxpause.com/):  Helps me stick to my twice a day 'batching' of emails.  Pauses my email flow after I enable it.  This is to prevent that nasty habit of working on a tough task, then switching to gmail so I can answer 2-3 'easy' emails\n\n***[Trello](http://Trello.com)***:  In my never-ending pursuit of Inbox Zero, I have rules for when I encounter a batch of emails:\n\n* If I can respond within 1-2 minutes, I respond\n\n* If it would take me more than 2 minutes, I create a task on Trello\n\n***Gmail Timer Logs:***  Automatically starts a timer whenever I open a new email\n\n***Chrome Extensions:***\n\n***[LastPASS](http://lastpass.com)***:  Saves all my passwords, auto-login, and form-fills my payment methods. Pro-tip: save info from one CC to use online only and then cut it up, nothing is more frustrating than losing my card at the bar and having to reset 20 different subscriptions\n\n[***Block Site***](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh?hl=en):  The best website blocker I've used.  Simple, works, and enough of a pain to disable that I usually don't bother\n\n[***The Great Suspender***](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg?hl=en):  When I work, I usually have 15-20 tabs open at a time, this suspends the background tabs so the open ones run faster\n\n***[AMZ Seller Browser](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amz-seller-browser/klgpelgeohjghmccooegimcfhanlnngc?hl=en)***:  Let's me easily see Price History and Sales Rank on Amazon to help me keep track of competition\n\n***[Alexa Traffic](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/alexa-traffic-rank/cknebhggccemgcnbidipinkifmmegdel?hl=en)*** + ***[Similarweb](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/similarweb-website-rankin/hoklmmgfnpapgjgcpechhaamimifchmp?hl=en)***:  Helps me quickly assess how much traffic any site gets.  Also a quick way to check page loading speed\n\n***[OpenVid](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/openvid-screen-mic-and-ca/liecbddmkiiihnedobmlmillhodjkdmb)***:  A quick way to record a screencast so you can show a designer exactly what you want fixed and not have to setup a whole screenshare\n\nProduct Development:\n\n***[Alibaba](http://Alibaba.com)***:  Still my first stop when it comes to searching for new products.  Just message suppliers asking them to email you back.  1. This avoids Alibaba's terribly designed messaging system  2.  This filters out suppliers who cannot follow simple instructions\n\n[***Whatsapp***](http://whatsapp.com):  Once you start working with a supplier, get them on whatsapp, Chinese tend to prefer messaging over email and I consider this my most important business relationship, so it's worth it\n\n[***Flexport***](http://flexport.com):  Not sure if they're accepting new members again yet, makes international freight forwarding as easy as ordering pizza\n\n[***Upgraded Images***](http://upgradedimages.com):  Ken at Upgraded Images is my go-to guy for getting great product photography that stands out.  Quick, affordable, and quality stuff\n\n[***SpeedyBarcodes***](https://speedybarcodes.com/):  Where I buy barcodes so I can sell on Amazon\n\nMarketing:\n\n***[Schedugram](http://schedugr.am)***:  Allows me to schedule Instagram posts in advance and have them automatically post (the only tech that does that automatically I believe)\n\n***[Repost](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/repost-for-instagram/id570315854?mt=8)***:  Repost other Instagram photos, usually of people who tag Woodies in a photo\n\n***[Instagram](http://instagram.com)*** and ^^[Snapchat](http://snapchat.com):  Can we all agree that Instagram is king and Snapchat has been demoted to court jester?  Here's my personal Instagram:  [WoodiesCaptain](http://instagram.com/woodiescaptain) and the [Woodies IG](http://instagram.com/woodies), if you're interested\n\n*also good for hitting up your WCW, just sliiiiiide in the DM and see if she'll post a pic*\n\n[***Mailchimp***](http://mailchimp.com):  Been using them for 4 years to send out emails, I send out really simple emails so I could probably downgrade to something else.  I'm also considering [***Klaviyo***](https://www.klaviyo.com/) because it's built specifically for Shopify. \n\nApps:\n\n[TripIt](http://tripit.com):  I travel full-time (don't have a home) so this keeps track of all my itineraries\n\n[***F.lux***](https://justgetflux.com/):  Dims my screen at night to give my eyes a break while I work late *highly recommended*\n\n***[Franz](http://meetfranz.com/)***:  Messaging app for Mac that combines Whatsapp, Messenger, Hangouts, Slack, Skype, and WeChat all in one easy to use client\n\nNot a fan:  StitchLabs, Shipwire, AppSumo is suddenly not my favorite app mostly because I can't figure it out, apps should just WORK or GTFO\n\nWhat apps or SaaS am I missing??\n\nps.  I don't have an app for this but I'm a HUGE fan of saying NO to people.  No, I don't sell wholesale. No, I don't ship internationally. No creates space for you to think clearly about what you really want.  No opens up time to work on truly important work\n\nI'll stick around to answer any questions, you can also PM me, or email Cory@Woodies.com \n\nSee you at the beach!\n\nCory Stout\n\nCaptain, [Woodies](https://woodies.com)",

      "title": "Alibaba Hacks: The most efficient way to find suppliers on the biggest sourcing website",
      "content": "After releasing the [Import Bible (64 pages free ebook on sourcing)](http://importdojo.com) some people wanted to know my workflow how I use Alibaba to cut down the time to find quality suppliers.\n\nI made a [20 minute screencast](http://importdojo.com/alibaba-hacks/) you can watch over here or for the basic outline of what I do, simply read below.\n\nFor the general sourcing workflow have a look at my previous [case study I posted on /r/entrepreneur few weeks ago here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/34x4l5/case_study_importing_a_power_bank_from_china_all/)\n\n**Today you want to source for an action camera, similar to the GoPro cameras.**\n\nYou can start by going to the main page of Alibaba.com and input **\u201caction camera\u201d** in the search option.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/TAfSglm\n\nOk, so you found 106,946 products. At this point you want to filter your results for the most relevant suppliers. You will definitely want the suppliers to be:\n\n**Gold suppliers:**\n\nThis is a paid membership from Alibaba for the supplier. They get featured and can put up a lot more items in their catalogue (among other functions).\n\n**Onsite Checked:**\n\nThe onsite operation of the factory has been checked by Alibaba and a third party confirmed its legal existence.\n\n**Assessed suppliers:**\n\nThis is a third-party assessment usually done through a testing company to verify various parts of the company. This includes machinery, staff, engineers, workers, certification, and much more.\n\nAfter you have filtered for this you are down to 8,258 products:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/tv8C48r\n\n**Insider tip:**\n\nNow you filter down to the relevant manufacturing province. Why? Because each province in China is specific for different product categories.\n\nIf you find a few suppliers (compared to hundreds in other provinces) on Alibaba in a certain region it is almost 100% certain they are a trading company. They either buy this certain product from somewhere else to round up their product catalogue (95% in all cases) or they are really manufacturing it.\n\nBut even if they are manufacturing it in their region they are likely less attractive in terms of prices, less experienced in manufacturing this product and their raw material suppliers are also somewhere far away. Ultimately making them less competitive.\n\nThere are several reasons why you will find suppliers for a specific product settled within a province.\n\n* The infrastructure for this product is good. Meaning there are a lot of suppliers in the area supplying components for the suppliers end-product\n* The workers in this area are skilled in producing this specific product. Making it easier to manufacture the end-product. Most likely, this also improves the overall quality.\n* The province has favourable tax rates for the factory on certain products.\nNow lets look at this again. Even though you didn\u2019t know the province and where the product is mainly manufactured you can get some insights on this very easily:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Nz546Eg\n\nGuangdong province has a total of 7,766 suppliers for this product. The other provinces have only a few. So you filter by this province.\n\nNow, you are looking to buy small quantities, lets say 10 pieces to start. You can filter the supplier by MOQ now:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Ctt6PcF\n\nNow lets look at the specific suppliers. You scroll down and by hovering over the Gold supplier symbol you will see quick facts. You are basically looking for a factory that has experience in your market. This specific supplier has experience in North America, Western & Eastern Europe.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/4hP6OFi\n\n**Insider tip:**\n\nYou will want a supplier who has experience in these markets because he is probably aware of specific country requirements & regulations.\nThis helps because he may already have applied for certificates for this product that you need when importing.\n\nNow look at the product page. What does the page tell you?\n\nhttp://imgur.com/hNs5zmX\n\nYou will find the following:\n\n* Supplier has 5 year \u201cGOLD\u201d membership, which is a good sign. If he had scammed someone before Alibaba would have deleted his account and not renewed it for 5 years.\n* Price is within a reasonable range\n* Your desired MOQ can be met (10 pieces)\n* Payment terms are acceptable. I would go for PayPal at this amount.\n* The company is rather young but that doesn\u2019t matter. These type of camera\u2019s got really popular around 2012 so a company that has been in that field prior to that has actually a lot of experience.\n\n**Insider tip: The trick here is to think outside the box.**\n\nDon\u2019t only look at a supplier and try to find some issue or problem. Think about the product too. Ask yourself questions such as \u201cdoes his product portfolio make sense\u201d? Is it in line with his other products? Or as for example the last point above, \u201cwhen did these things get popular\u201d?.\n\nNow when you scroll down there are several more good indicators. For example good product photos. **You will want a supplier that can send you high-resolution photos for your packaging or private label.**\n\nhttp://imgur.com/WmRb1Um\n\nYou will see available certifications. In this case what matters are **RoHS**, **CE** & **FCC**.\n\n**RoHs** certification is necessary for most European countries & the Americas. It prohibits certain hazardous material within the product.\n**CE** is a certification for Europe to meet general standards. Its good if a supplier has this\n**FCC** is a required certification on electrical products & also a standard for the US.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/nxdQZLx\n\nYou could already feel comfortable with this supplier, but you should check further on him in person by email.\n\nNext, click on the \u201ccontact details\u201d where you will find several things that help you to evaluate the supplier further.\n\nLook at the company profile and what you can find there.\n\nAlso look at the website outside Alibaba. If you cannot find his website outside Alibaba then google his company name and try to find it that way.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/20bfi7z\n\nWhen you look at the website, pay attention on what products they manufacture. If the seller advertises cameras on Alibaba and his main products outside Alibaba are pillows then you will know they are only trading the cameras and you should look for a new supplier at this stage.\n\nBut, this supplier has mainly cameras in their assortment. Looks good so far.\n\nWhat you notice is that their address is different than the one on Alibaba. At this stage it is probably their Hong Kong office that they use to invoice their customers. Many factories in China have a company in Hong Kong for tax and banking reasons. No need to be worried at this stage.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/CR0IOH1\n\nGoing back to Alibaba, you will want to contact the supplier with your request now. You need to sign in to Alibaba to send a message.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/l9Q1Y1f\n\nBasically you want to ask for a price, MOQ, delivery time and to which customers he is selling this item too. Obviously you also need to do routine checks on factory standards, product certifications and supplier profiles. If you would order from this factory later you should also look into having an inspection by a third-party.\n\nHere is what the inquiry could look like:\n\n*Hi\u2026,*\n\n*My name is \u2026.. and I am the \u2026.(Manager/President/Buyer etc.) of \u2026. Limited/Inc.*\n\n*We are a (fill in your company\u2019s business, e.g., Importer/Buying Office/Whole seller/Online shop) and are operating in (fill in your country).*\n*You can also check out our website: www. \u2026..*\n\n*I am writing you today to inquire about a product I saw on your website/catalogue/exhibition.*\n\n*Here is a link to the product I am looking for:*\n\n*http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Wifi-Sport-Camera-Wifi-Action-Camera_1880459810.html*\n\n*Could you please give me the following information:*\n\n*Unit price based on 10 Pieces*\n*Minimum Order Quantity*\n*Available certification (CE, RoHS, FCC, GS, etc.)*\n*Production lead time*\n*Available colors*\n*Payment terms*\n*You can fill in the details in the attached quotation format or send me your quotation in the first step. Then I will evaluate your offer and get back to* *you as soon as possible.*\n\n*If you have any questions please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me.*\n\n*Thanks and best regards,*\n\nYou should now repeat this step and send an inquiry to at least 3 more companies on Alibaba.\n\nIf he didn\u2019t follow up on all your questions make sure to email him back and ask again.\n\nFor example if you need to know about certifications and they didn\u2019t reply to that, ask them.\n\n**Insider tip:**\n\nSometimes suppliers put all available certifications on Alibaba but they don\u2019t tell you that they charge extra for them. A RoHS, CE or FCC certification can cost from 200USD up.\n\nAsk to see copies of certificates.\n\n* Do the certificates match up with the article number that the supplier gave you? \u2014 > If not, ask about it\n* Is the certificate expired? \u2014 > If yes, ask if he would renew once order is placed.\n* Who issued the certificate? \u2014 > If it is a local Chinese company google them and see what you can find about their service.\n* If they don\u2019t have certificates yet, ask them if they could apply for them once you place an order.\n\nMake sure you tell them that you will not release any payments if the certificates are not available upon shipment. If you book an inspection company, make sure to instruct your inspection company to check on this.\n\nOnce you received the suppliers feedback it is time to follow up with him on samples.\n\nFor more details on how to order & test your samples properly check my other articles:\n[Here](http://importdojo.com/sample-communication-with-your-suppliers-an-in-depth-guide/)\n&\n[Here](http://importdojo.com/testing-your-samples/)\n\nOther tips for Alibaba:\n\n**AliSource Pro**\nThere is a rather new service called AliSource Pro. You can basically send quotation requests to thousands of suppliers.\n\nHere is what it looks like:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/9sgvuHo\n\nYou can input all product details and submit. Within a few hours you should have a couple of offers.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Xu1STHk\n\nThe downside to this is that there is not much filtering. Random suppliers will send you offers and some of them don\u2019t even match your inquiry. I suggest filling in as many details as possible and then going trough the whole process of filtering & scanning a supplier as described above.\n\n**Google the supplier**\n\nIf you cannot find much about the supplier on Alibaba, Google the suppliers name and see what you can find. Perhaps even try \u201csupplier name forums\u201d.\nThat way you maybe find something (positive or negative) in forums about the supplier.\n\nThese are the basics of sourcing on Alibaba, of course there is more to that. [I provide plenty of information for free on my blog](http://importdojo.com) that will get you started. There is no need to delay getting into this business, with all the tools available these days everyone can start importing from overseas and building their own brand.\n\n",

      "content": "It\u2019s hard to imagine successful companies struggling to acquire customers. We see the successes with their hordes of fans and we think, \u201cWow, they\u2019re so lucky. They have it good.\u201d\n\nYet every single behemoth in existence once had to court its first customer.\n\n[In this post](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/how-to-get-first-customers/), I feature some of their stories. You\u2019ll find in them a generous mix of grunt work, guts, and genius.\n\n**1 & 2: Tinder and Alibaba \u2013 physically traveled to their first users**\n\n*Tinder went from 5,000 to 15,000 users by getting sorority girls to signup on the spot*\n\nCrucial to [Tinder\u2019s success](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/how-tinder-obtained-more-than-50-million-users-through-word-of-mouth/) was then-CMO Whitney Wolfe\u2019s ideas for building an early user-base. She planned a tour that would take her to prominent college campuses around the country.\n\n- She would go to chapters of her sorority, do her presentation, and have all the girls at the meetings install the app.\n- Then she\u2019d go to the corresponding brother fraternity\u2014they\u2019d open the app and see all these cute girls they knew.\n- Tinder had fewer than 5,000 users before Wolfe made her trip. When she returned, there were some 15,000.\u201d\n\n*Alibaba \u201cbrute-forced\u201d its success by visiting factories one by one*\n\nBack in the early \u201900s,  Jack Ma sent out a large sales force to fan out across the country, visiting factories one by one to show them how they could use Alibaba and Taobao to sell stuff online.\n\nBack then, a large number of factories in China weren\u2019t used to working with other people online, and sometimes didn\u2019t even have computers or Internet.\n\nIt was hard work, but companies quickly flocked to Alibaba and its holdings. This allowed them to get an edge over eBay.\n\n**3 & 4: Quora and Reddit \u2013 seeded their sites with their own content**\n\n*Founders solved the chicken-and-egg problem by contributing the bulk of early content themselves*\n\n[Quora](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/quora-marketing-strategy/) and Reddit are two of the largest online forums in existence today, but they were once ghost towns with the chicken-and-egg problem of \u201cempty site = no users / no users = empty site\u201d.\n\nQuora co-founders D\u2019Angelo, Cheever and Cox wrote most of the earliest questions and answers themselves. The first employees and beta testers then continued this trend, until the platform generated enough activity for them to stop.\n\nReddit did the same, but it also created fake profiles. According co-founder Steve Huffman, it took several months before the front page would fill up organically without their submissions.\n\n**5 & 6: Threadless and Dropbox \u2013 the biggest believers in word-of-mouth**\n\n*Dropbox launched shared folders and a massive referral campaign*\n\nThe Dropbox empire was built on referrals.\n\n- With its massive word of mouth campaign, Dropbox grew its user base by 40 times \u2013 from 100,000 to 4,000,000.\n- In April 2010 alone, Dropbox users sent 2.8 million direct referral invites.\n- But on top of that, Dropbox itself was designed to encourage sharing. They introduced shared folders, a nifty feature that encouraged users to invite others to share access to folders.\n\n*Threadless let its community run their own initiatives*\n\nOne of Threadless\u2019 crucial early moves was to start a massive word-of-mouth campaign.\n\nFrom the get-go, [Threadless supported community](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/threadless-marketing-strategy/) initiated \u201crogue contests\u201d(spontaneous, themed tee shirt contests).\n\nIn turn, its community is insanely creative, and also fiercely loyal brand advocates.\n\n**7: Black Milk: Fashion + Fandoms = Great Success!**\n\nThe clothing store achieved its impressive growth by milking fandom for its worth. It didn\u2019t stop at making pop culture-inspired apparel \u2013 it established serious legitimacy by getting official license for all their geeky wear.\n\nIt\u2019s also made its Facebook page a fandom watering hole. Over there, dedicated \u201cSharkies\u201d can connect with like-minded fans.\n\nThere\u2019s even a Black Milk-approved group where girls can swap, buy, and sell their purchases with each other.\n\n**8: OKCupid \u2013 legendary content on OKTrends averaged 4,222 tweets per post**\n\nThe content on OKTrends was so mindblowingly insightful that people actually despaired when it was discontinued. Who wouldn\u2019t want to read and share this post titled \u201c10 Charts About Sex\u201c? (Do it, it\u2019s worth all your attention.)\n\nFrom August 2010 to April 2011, OkTrends posts averaged a staggering 32,500 Facebook likes and 4,222 tweets.\n\nCo-founder Rudder says, \u201cHonestly I think the blog\u2013one way or another\u2013has driven a lot of our growth. Certainly, it has driven brand awareness. It\u2019s been the only thing we\u2019ve ever done, other than making a great dating site, that has gotten us out there into the world.\u201d\n\n**9: Etsy \u2013 harvested interest by reaching out to target communities before launching**\n\n[Etsy founders](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/etsy-marketing-strategy/) used to run a web design shop and were working on getcrafty.com for one of their projects, during which they discovered the need for a marketplace for handmade crafts.\n\nSo, while they built Etsy, they reached out to the craft community on getcrafty.com and Craftster.org, which had an even larger user base.\n\nBy the time they launched, they already had a lot of interest generated among the two platforms, and that helped get the required inventory and start off transactions on Etsy.\n\n**10: Buffer \u2013 got to 100k users primarily through frequent guest blogging**\n\nCo-founder Leo Wildrich wrote 150 guest posts in the first 9 months of running Buffer, and he swears by it. That\u2019s 16-17 posts per month, or more than 1 every two days!\n\n\u201cRelationships are actually the most valuable things that you gain from guest posting. At the end of the day, if you do a lot of guest posting you simply make a lot of friends. I\u2019ve got great friends over at Treehouse, Social Media Examiner, SocialMouths, and other great sites. You provide someone with free content, that\u2019s a great favor if you think about it, so it\u2019s a great opportunity to make friends with these awesome people.\u201d\n\n**11: ASOS \u2013 the ecommerce store mailed its own print magazine to 400,000 customers**\n\nBack in 2006, CEO Nick Robertson insisted that the glossy print catalog was still key to making the brand an essential part of customers\u2019 lives. Today, besides maintaining a content-rich site, ASOS also has a magazine with a circulation of 456,000 \u2013 the 18th largest in the UK, immediately behind Glamour and Closer, and just a handful of places behind New.\n\nUnconditional, free shipping was irresistable.\n\nOne of the things that kept customers flocking to ASOS was its incredible shipping and returns policy \u2013 even in its early days, ASOS was shipping for free and without minimum purchase. That policy has only just recently changed, but ASOS already has a loyal fanbase worldwide.\n\n**12 & 13: Twitter and Foursquare \u2013 exploded their userbases at SXSW with guerrilla marketing**\n\n*SXSW 2007 \u2013 Twitter lived streamed the conference on huge plasma screens*\n\nCo-founder Evan Williams decided to visualize the service on 60 inch plasma screens in the hallways, because \u201cWe knew hallways were where the action was\u201d. Twitter created an event-specific feature that allowed attendees to follow a handful of \u201cambassadors\u201d.\n\nAccording to Newsweek\u2019s Steven Levy, \u201cHundreds of conference-goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters. Panelists and speakers mentioned the service, and the bloggers in attendance touted it.\u201d During the event, Twitter usage went from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000.\n\n*Foursquare \u2013 grew average check-ins from 250k to 350k with just chalk and rubber balls*\n\nFoursquare didn\u2019t have a booth like most other brands at the 2010 SXSW convention. Neither did it have Twitter\u2019s marketing budget (Twitter spent $11k on its SXSW campaign). Instead, it set up an actual game of \u201cfour square\u201d in front of the convention hall, which involved just chalk and two rubber balls.\n\nThe game drew thousands of walk-up participants [1], Said CEO Dennis Crowley, \u201cWe played all day long, and there was always a waiting line. We were handing out tee shirts, buttons, and stickers. Anytime someone didn\u2019t know what Foursquare was, we helped them find it on their phone. We helped get them up and running and using it.\u201d\n\n**14: Taskrabbit \u2013 focused on delighting moms in Boston**\n\nTaskrabbit first cornered the market with one mothers\u2019 group in Boston\n\nTaskrabbit is similar to Uber in its hyperlocal focus. Leah Busque talked about Taskrabbit\u2019s early traction in response to a question \u201cHow did you acquire your first 10,000 users?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can be tempting to just go really broad, really wide scale, really fast. But for us, we just focused on a customer segment. We focused on this mothers\u2019 group in Boston. And once we had cornered that market with that moms\u2019 group, those moms were talking to other moms on Beacon Hill and Backbay and Cambridge and it just spread from there.\u201d\n\n**15: Airbnb \u2013 shuttled from coast to coast to talk to their first users**\n\n*Founders went the extra mile for their earliest users*\n\nFounders Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk and Joe Gebbia acted on Paul Graham\u2019s advice in their Y Combinator days and \u201cdid things that didn\u2019t scale\u201d. Specifically, they went to NYC to acquire their earliest users, then followed up with them extensively.\n\n\u201cWhen New York took off, we flew back every weekend. We went door to door with cameras taking pictures of all these apartments to put them online. I lived in their living rooms. And home by home, block by block, communities started growing. And people would visit New York and bring the idea back with them to their city.\u201d \u2013 Brian Chesky, for The Atlantic\n\n\u201cBecause of the Democratic National Conventions, some people were using the site in New York and listing places. We would reach out to the very few people we had and get to know them, figure out what products they needed and what we could offer them. We tried to build loyalty knowing that if we did that, they would tell their friends. We\u2019d host parties and meetups and all sorts of different things. \n\nThrough that process, they\u2019d get very excited and tell their friends about Airbnb. It was mostly about generating as much buzz and excitement to get them to tell their friends about us.\u201d \u2013 Chesky, Startups Open-sourced\n\n*Airbnb believed in generating word-of-mouth, which would attract the press, which would generate more word-of-mouth*\n\n\u201cWe never dressed up in gorilla suits but we passed out fliers in coffee shops, train stations\u2014we did all sorts of things. I don\u2019t know what tactics worked more than others, but I think press was always the number one tactic for us. The press would spark another group of users, then we\u2019d go visit those people and talk to them and get them excited. It was a pattern that repeated itself.\u201d \u2013 Chesky, Startups Open-sourced\n\n**16: Yelp \u2013 grew a loyal user base by rewarding quality reviews**\n\n*Gave \u201cKudos\u201d for good behavior*\n\nYelp wanted to create a tight community of consistent reviewers and high quality reviews. It rightly guessed that people were more likely to write in-depth, well crafted reviews when their names appeared alongside them. So it offered special recognition to users who were first to review a business, and let other users give kudos for reviews that are useful, funny, or cool.\n\nAnd the numbers in 2006 show that most Yelp reviewers got hooked on the site:\n\nUsers who contributed 6 or more reviews:\n\nCitySearch \u2013 4.8%\nYahoo Local \u2013 11.1%\nYelp \u2013 65.8%\nUsers who left only one review:\n\nCitySearch \u2013 71.2%\nYahoo Local \u2013 56.4%\nYelp \u2013 9.2%\n\n*Treated their best \u201cElite\u201d users generously*\n\nThe most engaged Yelp users are elevated to \u201cElite\u201d status, visible by a shiny Elite badge on their account profile. By 2006, a full 44% of reviews on the site were contributed by Yelp Elite. \n\nDave Kim, a six-year Yelp Elite user with over 900 reviews, explains:\n\n\u201cYelp does a good job of finding ways to reward people, not through monetary means, but little perks \u2026 At regular Yelp Events, Elites often got first-chance to RSVP and even got in an hour before everyone else. There are specific events just for Yelp Elite that offer free food and drinks and swag.\u201d\n\n**17: Groove \u2013 reached out to the customers that \u201cgot away\u201d**\n\nCEO Alex Turnbull has written a very detailed analysis of Groove\u2019s early customer acquisition tactics, along the theme of doing things that don\u2019t scale. The tactic that stood out the most was scrapping \u2013 reaching out to customers who chose other competitors, and sincerely asking the reasons for their choice. From the exercise, Turnbull discovered and fixed several bugs, and convince customers to give Groove another chance.\n\n\n",

      "title": "I became a self made millionaire at 25 in a third world country. I will share my story here:",
      "content": "I am from Central America, a tropical region with lots of poverty and problems.\nSince I was a kid, I had the drive to put extra effort on achieving something. I started selling bananas to construction workers at 7 later selling candy to schoolmates at 10.\n\nAt 15 I decided to study business and become either an over achiever employee or a business owner, at that time I didn\u2019t exactly know which path to take.\nWhile I was in university (BA studies), I noticed I had a lot of spare time after school, so instead of wasting my time on leisure, I decided to start a business, I had no clue of which kind of business start (also to start one that didn\u2019t require much money because I had none.) I met with fellow classmates that were smart and also wanted to stand out, so together we decided to start a coffee distribution company. \n\nWe were offering coffee to restaurants and hotels but competition was very tough and we just couldn\u2019t close deals to get to break even. I started noticing the first signs of a red ocean industry and how tough it is to stand out in that kind of industry. My cofounders were not putting the same effort as I was, and that frustrated me. At a point my dorm served as the company\u2019s warehouse, packing center and distribution center, I was closing almost all of the sales with clients and also doing the delivery. I noticed many companies offered high quality coffee but only a few offered high quality tea. Also in my region (a coffee growing region) there are a lot of coffee sellers as we live in a coffee growing country. Tea was always imported from Asia and few companies actually focused on it. I noticed there was an opportunity on focusing on tea, instead of coffee. \n\nI offered my cofounders to buy their shares and they agreed (for them it was a relief) so I started sourcing tea that was grown locally and mixing it with herbs, spiced and fruits to create tasty tea blends. The product was very good and without competitors, so I went to Mcdonald\u2019s HQ and offered the product for Mccafe. Mcdonald\u2019s loved the product and agreed on the price (they also liked that I was very young). My tea processing was being done at my dorm so I lacked all the licenses required to supply at Mcdonald\u2019s standards, so I was very sincere with the Supply Chain director and told him I had all the desire but lacked the money to build the proper tea facility. I offered him teapots and with the teapot earnings I could buy the machinery and equipment required to supply them properly and also to get the sanitary approvals. He agreed on the teapots and gave me a 50% advance ($50k) for them. I bought 5,000 teapots in Alibaba (China) for $3 each and sold them at $20 to Mccafe. I used all the profits to build the facility and it took me almost one year to finally start supplying Mcdonald\u2019s.\n\n\nWhile I was already supplying them, I noticed the tea market was very small (a Blue Ocean kind, but actually a blue pond) \nMy ambitious goals (become a billionaire at 35) would be tough to reach staying exclusively in the tea industry.\nI kept hustling for two years on the tea, until an opportunity came to me (or I came to it).\n\n\nWhile I was offering tea to a sushi restaurant, out of curiosity, asked if the fish served there was locally caught.\nThe owner said; \u201cNo, it comes from Asia because local fish has bad quality and I can\u2019t risk my restaurant\u2019s reputation or client\u2019s health giving them bad quality fish.\u201d\n\nIt startled me that local restaurants didn\u2019t use local fish even though we have plenty access to both Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. Seemed like an obvious problem, so I started to find out why, what asians did right and what us, central americans did wrong.\n\nAfter months of obsessive research, the problem was lack of knowledge and investment in the local fishing industry resulting in fisherman living in poverty conditions with no ability to supply high quality fish. The solution was to teach them good practices and invest in a high quality seafood processing facility, the cost of the solution was over $400,000 in investment money that I didn\u2019t had.\n\n\nSo I decided to build a team, test out our theory and provide the product to restaurants and learn form their feedback. It was a lean start up mentality to start small and cheap to prove the business thesis. We received excellent feedback and real purchase interest from restaurants.\nThat was enough to know it was a great opportunity and also a huge market potential for growth.\nSo I decided to pitch my way up until I could secure the funds.\nAfter a year of pitching, I was far from the goal (securing $400k in a third world country is nearly impossible if you are a young entrepreneur with an idea.)\nSo I started enrolling in international entrepreneurship competitions, I was able to compete in GSEA and then Hult Prize. I didn\u2019t win them, (earned a 2nd place in both) but it was enough to broaden my network with wealthy investors with deep pockets. \n\nI secured funding early 2020 and started building the fish facility in February, the Covid lockdown hit us hard and we couldn\u2019t deliver what our investor expected.\nSo legal fights came, with lawyers I couldn\u2019t afford, while managing a born-dead company, while also pitching again to secure more funds to get us out of the hole.\nOur initial investor agreed to sell his shares if given 40% ROI, paid $150k up front and semestral payments for 5 years \n\nA new investment fund gave us a loan to pay back the previous investor and additional $300k for working capital. Very high interest rate, but at least we got a runway to prove our business through time.\n\nAfter restructuring and getting rid of internal and external bad apples, we started buying, processing and selling fish in May 2021, we closed 2021 with $2m in revenue and we will close 2022 with $10m revenue, beyond supplying fish to local restaurants we also provide fresh fish (airplane delivery) to restaurants in Miami, NY, LA, frozen fish to hotel chains all over America.\nWe have healthy debts now, a good EBITDA and a growth trajectory that will put us in $100m annual revenue in less than ten years, we will keep reinvesting profits on CAPEX and OPEX to keep up with the growth trajectory.\n\nGod has been an integral part of my journey.\n\nLessons learned:\n1. Vision and Goals must be clear.\n2. The path can change, the goals can\u2019t.\n3. Having a mission is key.\n4. Hustle, Hustle, Hustle\n5.

China is crazy.\n\n\n\n* China is filled with factories, most of which barely know the end product for which they make parts for. Still they are integral to the manufacturing process and will do a great job if you know how to ask them to.\n\n\n\n* Most factories are dirty, have poor/sub-par working conditions, and are located in rural districts outside the of small cities. \nhttp://imgur.com/8tVTcKS,oILFeZq (making sofas)\nhttp://imgur.com/8tVTcKS,oILFeZq#1 (coating steel frames)\nIt's not the best place for hardcore humanitarian types to visit.\n\n\n\n**FAQ**\n\n* *Should I buy from company X on Alibaba?* Probably not. It's unlikely they are the actual manufacturer. They do not have the product in stock. If you negotiate down they will find a manufacturer to lessen the quality to retain their margin. Believe it or not, factories can be very loyal, so expect a battle if you want to dump your supplier and go straight to the mfg later on. \n\n* *Should I hire a sourcing company?* If you just need one part and are not really concerned about developing more business in China, go for it. Overall, I'm not too fond of these companies. They tend to rest on the fact you don't know what you're doing. I've met sourcing experts who have never left the comforts of their major city. \n\n* *OK, so how do I source a product then?* While there isn't a silver-bullet, find someone you trust. Build a relationship over small business. Make it mutually beneficial for your company to grow. There are certainly some very motivated individuals out there.\n\n* *How do I actually import my product?* Find a freight forwarding company, preferably one that has offices near both ports. They will arrange for trucking to port, ocean freight, customs brokerage, documentation, etc. Have multiple forwarders give you line item quotes to ensure you don't get ripped off. Realistically importing a 20' container into the US will be about $2.5k-$4k (+ any import duty). \n\n",

      "title": "I\u2019m $141,000 in Debt After Chasing Big Dreams. Sometimes, it\u2019s okay to give up",
      "content": "I honestly don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I\u2019ve spent years chasing big dreams, pouring everything I had\u2014money, energy, and hope\u2014into chasing success and working towards my goals and dreams. And now I\u2019m sitting here with 8 million pesos (about $141,000) in debt, questioning everything about myself. Why do I dream so big? Why do I keep thinking I can make it? Why can\u2019t I stop?\n\nIt all started in 2019 when I opened my first physical store. I started small, renting an exhibit space to test the market, and to my surprise, it worked. I was making 50,000 pesos (around $880) a month in profit(I was selling women and kids clothing imported from China). That little success felt like validation. I thought, \u201cThis is it!\u201d So, I went all in. I took out a 1 million peso loan (about $17,650) to open a full-scale store. Renovations, stocks\u2014it all felt like the right move.\n\nAnd then COVID hit. Everything shut down, and I was forced to try online. Since I had loans to pay, I had no choice. To my surprise, the online store took off. To think that people were stuck at home, who would buy clothes for going out at a time like this. But! It was became wildly profitable\u2014more than I could have imagined. In December 2020, I hit my biggest milestone: 400,000 pesos (around $7,060) in sales in just 24 hours. I thought I had finally made it. I believed it would always be like this, that this is just the beginning and it will only get better from here.\n\nSo, I doubled down. I secured another loan to increase stock, believing that the more I had, the more I\u2019d sell(this time I was only focusing on children\u2019s clothing and shoes since that is what sold out fast). I was so optimistic, so confident. But 2021 was different. Sales slowed, and I wasn\u2019t paying attention to the numbers. I wasn\u2019t tracking my profit margins or operational costs properly. I just kept pushing forward, thinking I could turn things around if I spent more on ads. I was wrong.\n\nThe debt kept piling up. I had to shut the business down, but my family stepped in. They believed in me, and honestly, I felt like I couldn\u2019t stop. They supported me financially, encouraged me to start again. So, I took out another loan, believing that this time would be different. But it wasn\u2019t. I launched new products, and they didn\u2019t work. I shut down again. And then, because I couldn\u2019t give up, I tried again. And again. And again.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2023, my brand generated 29 million pesos (about $512,000) in sales. I spent an estimated 8 million pesos (about $141,000) on ads alone. I was able to grow my social media presence to 227k followers on facebook and 11k on instagram. I had local celebrities and influencers reaching out to me for collaboration during those times. Yet, somehow, here I am, with nothing to show for it but overwhelming debt and a heart full of regret. I have no idea where the money went. Operational costs were through the roof. At one point, I rented a warehouse for 50,000 pesos ($880) a month. I hired more employees and raised their salaries significantly because I truly believed that the success I had in December 2020 would continue forever.\n\nIt didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve shut the business down for good now. This year, I tried affiliate marketing(US based). My first month was profitable\u2014I made 60,000 pesos ($1,060). I thought, maybe this is it. Maybe I\u2019ve finally found something that works. But again, it fell apart. I ended up adding another 250,000 pesos ($4,400) to my debt(through facebook ads). Then I wrote and launched an ebook, pouring everything into it. Ads, campaigns, promotions\u2014it added another 250,000 pesos to my debt. I really thought, maybe I went through everything for this moment. I was sharing something I believed in deeply\u2014the secret supplier, the supplier of all suppliers. Profit was, of course, the first priority, but this time it felt different. I wanted to become successful while helping others achieve their success too.\n\nBut in the end, once again, it wasn\u2019t. It failed just like the rest, and the heartbreak was unbearable. I had poured my hope, my energy, and my belief into this, thinking it was finally my moment. Instead, it became another painful reminder of how far I\u2019d fallen.\n\nEvery failure has led me deeper into depression. It\u2019s heavy. So heavy. Earlier this year I took so many courses and read books on mindset. And when I tried new things, I also did it with a new mindset. And now, I\u2019m so scared to go back to the person I was before. During all those times when I was chasing success I was miserable. Stuck on survival mode that it affected how I was as a person, mom, wife, daughter and friend. At some point I\u2019m proud of the person I am now, because if I was still who I was these past years I would seriously be contemplating ending my life. And the worst part? My parents. They\u2019ve stepped in so many times, covering loans, supporting me, believing in me. They shouldn\u2019t have to. They\u2019re at an age where they should be resting, enjoying life, not worrying about their daughter\u2019s financial mess. I feel like I\u2019ve failed them spectacularly\u2014over and over again. I was supposed to retire them early, to give back after all they\u2019ve given me. Instead, I\u2019ve only added to their stress.\n\nI keep asking myself, why do I dream so big? Why can\u2019t I just accept a normal life, a stable life? Why can\u2019t I stop chasing this idea that I\u2019m meant for more? I feel like I\u2019ve been stuck in this cycle for years\u2014dreaming, failing, trying again. And now, I\u2019m at the point where I don\u2019t even know who I am without those dreams. I\u2019m tired. I feel defeated. I don\u2019t know how to move forward, but I know I can\u2019t keep going like this.\n\nTo anyone reading this: How do you let go of your dreams and accept that, no matter how deeply you knew in your heart you were meant for greatness, you\u2019re not? I\u2019m 31 years old.\n\nEDIT: \n\nI want to thank everyone who took the time and effort to comment on my post. Your empathy, insights, and advice have been incredibly valuable, and I truly appreciate the kindness and support you\u2019ve shown.\n\nFor context, I\u2019ve taken multiple courses on Facebook ads and marketing, which helped me grow my following and achieve those sales figures. My first business was actually profitable in terms of ad cost versus revenue. However, I rushed things and made decisions that weren\u2019t realistic. Looking back, if I had taken it slow, avoided loans, and been content with making 100k-300k pesos (roughly $1,800-$5,400) a day, the business might still be alive today. Unfortunately, I wanted more\u2014so I took loans, got a warehouse, and hired more employees. When sales slowed down, the loan payments piled up, and I eventually had to shut it all down last year, in 2023.\n\nThis year, I tried affiliate marketing through ClickBank (after taking another course). It was profitable at first, but like before, it eventually wasn\u2019t sustainable. I only tried two products and one MRR (Master Resell Rights) product, and while I generated significant revenue, it still wasn\u2019t enough to turn a profit overall.\n\nLastly, despite wanting to \u201cgatekeep\u201d my supplier (their value lies in being a direct Chinese platform for factories and manufacturers\u2014most sellers on Alibaba and AliExpress are just middlemen and their supplier is this supplier), my sister encouraged me to write an ebook about it since I no longer plan to sell physical products. The goal was to help others while also helping myself.\n\nMoving forward, I\u2019ve decided to focus on freelancing or virtual assistance to gain stability and work toward reducing my debt rather than adding more to it.\n\nI also want to add how grateful I am to have heard from strangers this time. It\u2019s given me a different perspective\u2014a view I couldn\u2019t see on my own.",

Lacking of excitements, perhaps its too easy, in some aspects so ..\n\nI made a leap that some might call crazy\u2014I left my $230k job in finance to start my own sourcing company in China. It's been a whirlwind of emotions, but oddly, it feels good.   \nIn finance, my days were predictable. I had set tasks, clear goals, and a pretty good idea of what my paycheck would look like at the end of the year. It was comfortable, but somewhere along the line, it started to feel a bit too... scripted. I craved something more, something that felt like my own.  \nTransitioning to running my own business was like stepping into a different world. Suddenly, there were no clear-cut tasks at the start of each day, no guaranteed paycheck waiting for me. The uncertainty was daunting. Every decision felt like a gamble. Would this supplier be reliable? Can I ensure the quality of the products? How do I manage logistics, warehousing, and especially the nuances of communication and customization with Chinese factories?   \nBut here's the thing\u2014despite the sleepless nights and the steep learning curve, there's a part of this journey that's incredibly fulfilling. For every challenge, there's a victory. For every setback, a lesson learned. The freedom to steer my own ship, to build something from the ground up, has brought a sense of accomplishment I never found in my previous job.  \nI've come to realize that the unpredictability is not a bug; it's a feature. It's what keeps me on my toes, pushes me to innovate, and forces me to grow. And while the path of a business owner is fraught with challenges  \nHere's to the weirdly good feeling of embracing the unknown.  \n",

I'm looking for more of a private agent than an own way to get to suppliers. A person that can hook me up with both drop for testing and private label for scaling. Where do I even start looking for one? I'm not really keen on looking for anyone on Reddit for that cuz \"my friend we're the best I provide for you cheap price fast shipping\" is not convincing to me. I know damn well a private agent will promise me a candy land, but I've had a 2 or 3 - one found on Reddit who turned out terrible despite promising whatnot. A person lurking for a client in every Reddit post doesn't seem to be reliable in the first place, but well, correct me if I'm wrong. \n2. Is there any other way than to simply start working with someone to determine credibility of that agent? \n3. Is it better to approach agents in Chinese than English? I've translated a few stores in the past few months and handled multilingual customer support, so I'm pretty used to using chat GPT for talking in other languages - and since the language barrier seems to be a problem quite often, I would be fine talking in Chinese, I think\n4. Will a good private agent won't even talk to me, if I don't have a certain MOQ? I know private agent is usually a next step, rather than getting one when the store is not even up - but when you want to sell products almost no one sells, or a variation of it that no one sells - you need to source it with ways out of reach for most people. So a product that's not available on Ali, or CJ, or wherever. I don't want to be the 12th guy selling the same neck massager, got dang it\n5. Are agencies better than private agents? I know they're more expensive, but what about performance?\n6. How did you find your agent, and how is it going? Tell me your story mate! ",

Fast forward 2 months later, I have finally recieved my stock and the logo locations are all WRONG and nothing like compared to the sample locations. Also they are not straight and aligned as per the approved samples. The supplier is trying to argue a little (overall they do seem to take blame), by saying they sent photos prior to shipping. The photos you could not really gauge the height of the logo relative to the product, my assumption is that all logos would be as per the 5 x samples i got, why would they change??  \n\n\nWhat options do I have here? This supplier is the only supplier I know that makes this product the way I like it, so I do not want our relationship to sour over this. The order does have trade assurance, but a refund and then remanufacturing all of these items seems like a huge delay, we wanted to launch this month and this has stuffed us....\n\nAny ideas?",

      "title": "AI Will Make You Extremely Rich or Kill Your Business in 2024",
      "content": "**Preface:** I'm a solo-founder in the AI space and previously worked as an ML scientist; the new advancements in AI that I'm seeing are going to impact everyone here. It doesn't matter if you're just starting out, or a bootstrapped brick and mortar founder, or even a VC backed hard tech founder. Last year was when the seeds were laid, and this is the year we'll see them bloom. There will be an onslaught of advancements that take place that are borderline inconceivable due to the nature of exponential progress. This will change every single vertical.\n\nI'm making this post because I think AI execution strategy will make or break businesses. Dramatically. Over **$50B** was put into AI startups in 2023 alone. This figure excludes the hundreds of billions poured into AI from enterprises. So, let's follow the money:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1) AI enterprise software.**\n\nThere's a lot to unpack here and this is what I\u2019m currently working on. AI enterprise software will encompass everything from hyper personalized email outbound to AI cold calls to AI that A/B tests ads on synthetic data to vertical specific software. The impact of the former is relatively self explanatory, so I'll focus on the latter. To illustrate vertical specific AI software, I'll use a simple example in the legal space. Lawyers typically have to comb through thousands of pages of documents. Now, using an LLM + a VDB, an AI can instantly answer all of those questions while surfacing the source and highlighting the specific answer in the contract/document. There are dozens of AI startups for this use case alone. This saves lawyers an immense amount of time and allows them to move faster. Firms that adopt this have a fundamental advantage over law firms that don't adopt this. This was 2023 technology. I'm seeing vertical AI software getting built by my friends in areas from construction, to real estate, to even niche areas like chimney manufacturing. This will exist everywhere. Now, this can be extrapolated much further to be applicable to systems that can do reports and even browse the Internet. This brings me to my next point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2) AI information aggregation and spread.**\n\nMy gut tells me that this will have a crescendo moment in the future with hardware advancements (*Rabbit, Tab, etc.*). You won't have to google things because it will be surfaced to you. It's predictive in nature. The people who can get information the fastest will grow their business the fastest. This part is semi-speculative, but due to the nature of LLMs being so expensive to train, I have a strong feeling that large institutions will have access to the *\\*fastest\\** and *\\*best\\** models that can do this quicker than you and I can. This is why it's important to stay on top.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3) AI content generation**\n\nThis is relevant to running advertisements and any digital marketing aspect of your business. If you can rapidly make content faster than your competitors to put in social media, you will outpace your competitors rapidly. I think most folks are familiar with MidJourney, Stable diffusion, etc. but don't know how to use it. You can generate consistent models for a clothing brand or generate images of a product that you would normally need to hire a professional photographer to take. There's also elevenlabs which is relatively easy to use and can be used to make an MP3 clip as a narration for an ad; this is something I've already done. I'm also still shocked by how many people are unfamiliar with tools like [**Pika**](https://pika.art) which can do video generation. You could imagine companies having ***fleets of digital influencers*** that they control or conjuring up the perfect ad for a specific demographic using a combination of all of the aforementioned tools.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In summary,** if you feel like I'm being hyperbolic or propagating science fiction fantasies, you're likely already behind. I truly recommend that everyone stays up to date on these advancements as much as possible. If your competitor comes across an AI tool that can increase their ROAS by 5x they can crush you. If your competitor uses a tool that increases the rate at which they receive and aggregate information by 200% (modest estimate) they will crush you. If your competitors have a tool that can reduce their employee size, then they will use it. They'll fire their employees to cut costs and reinvest the money back into their business. It will compound to the point where you're outpaced, and this isn't a level of innovation we've seen since the birth of the industrial revolution. Your customers can get stolen overnight, or you can steal your competition\u2019s customers overnight.\n\n**TL;DR:** This is an opportunity for entrepreneurs to scale faster than they could have possibly imagined, but this also comes with the potential for your company to be obliterated. We've never seen advancements that can have this drastic of an impact this quickly. Adoption will happen fast, and first movers will have a disproportionate and compounding advantage. Watch guides, meet with startups, follow the news, and get rich.",

      "title": "How I've been making over 10k / mon. since 20 (25 now)",
      "content": "Want to give some value, in particular for the younger guys, as I know how the online entrepreneur space is these days. SMMA, dropshipping, crypto, lambos, Miami, Dubai, I know what it's like to see that stuff all over the internet. All of these gurus, infoproduct guys, etc. etc. \n\nMy average month is about 20k-30k now, I do real life business, I didn't just hit it once, It has been consistent. I had a clothing brand agency, well still do, and my biggest month was about 25k Rev, but the majority of money I've made was in sales. I've tried dropshipping, SMMA, Crypto, all of it. My first sales job was as a door to door canvasser, setting free roof inspections for a roofing company at 19. I didn't want to do it, I had too much pride, always told myself I'd run my own company, be a millionaire before everyone else. I was the only kid my age at the time into self improvement, going to seminars, Tony Robbins, Gary Vee, etc. but I didn't have the vehicle to make my first money yet. I eventually lost my job, car got totaled, I was late on rent, no source of transportation and this offer came up. Long story short, I did it and made my rent that first week, which was $1,000 at the time (2018). The sales guys that were closing all made over $100k. Before you make a million, you need to surpass six figures. \n\nNow I'll get deeper into the specific industry I'm in but I want to highlight D2D, and sales in general as it relates to entrepreneurs. The entrepreneurial spirit is something some of us are born and gifted with. It is only a matter of time before you find the vehicle to express that. Entrepreneurship is a sport to a degree, but it's a mental one, not physical. There are skillsets involved, like in sports. A fighter will train to enhance his skills, speed, power, cardio, different fighting styles, boxing, BJJ, etc. I say this because as an entrepreneur, your ability to succeed depends on your strengths and weaknesses, and building your strengths is only a matter of putting in reps. No course or PDF will put reps in for you. You need to train and persistently put in those reps to enhance those skills that translate into desired outcomes and results. This is where sales comes in. D2D is unlimited entrepreneurship training, and the best part is you get paid to learn. If you started a business from scratch right now, with no experience, you'd need to sell one of two things, a product, or a service. Now in the creation of that product or service, there are skillsets involved in doing so, you have to build those, and if you want to succeed at them, you have to get good as well. In sales, its one primary skill, you're selling someone else's product or service, so you don't have to worry about the fulfillment or management of that business. Sales and marketing drive revenue simply speaking. If you can sell and market, you can profit. Where many young people, myself included, go wrong, is they hear about these business models that these guys teach, and try to manage a business that they know nothing about. They tell you how they made $10k, $100k per month. And give you a blue print of what they're doing, but you didn't put in the reps they did. If LeBron put out a course on how to shoot better, I imagine there's some value in that, but you aren't putting in LeBrons work, and with his natural gifts, so you're not going to become him. Lock in on whats in front of you and progress by mastering one thing, then learning the next skillset you know you'll need to learn on the trajectory to become a master CEO. This is the way, not chasing online trends. FB ads changes, Tik Tik changes, Instagram changes, markets get saturated. Build you. \n\nNow what is the industry I'm in? Exterior home restoration. What is that? Well basically we complete work on homes from storm damage, hail, winds, tornadoes, hurricanes, etc. and insurance pays for the work. Every home owner has insurance, and these companies pay for repairs to be completed. Like an auto body shop, if you crash a car, or got hail damage, the company pays the shop, shop does the work, and boom everyone's happy. I started setting leads, went on to closing deals, then later started project managing. Roofing was the bread and butter, but I've made the most of money so far doing niche high end windows that get damaged by hail. These windows are 5x the cost of a roof, and most contractors have no clue how to deal with the claims and install. I have an LLC and subcontracted by the contractors to generate deals. I close the deals, they complete the work. This is my business, and it works well. I get a $5k avg. per deal, and I sell a lot. If you're interested in learning more about this specific industry fire away questions or DM me, I'm more than happy to help. ",

      "title": "What I learnt from sourcing e-commerce products from China.",
      "content": "DISCLAIMER: The intention of this to increase cautiousness and practice best practices between the entrepreneurs that are importing from China. \n\nSo I have been running an e-commerce store for a very long time, not a drop-shipping particularly but we would order the products in bulk to the country and then ship from there (For faster shipping).I wanted to do drop-shipping but then it halted back in 2019, right after the COVID and ePacket was banned >!(ePacket is a shipping agreement between US and China to reduce shipping times, it uses passenger planes to carry the parcel, hence faster shipping)!<.\n\nAnyway getting back to the point, We were selling jewellery in the United States, firstly we used to just order from Aliexpress (a bunch of 500 every week) to our warehouse, do the quality check and then we would ship it from there. However the price per item was $7.80 and it was selling for $25.99 with a good profit margin.\n\nWe decided to scale that store (I shared the scaling strategy in a different blog post) by going to a supplier and ordering 10K since Q4 was coming up and we were trying to scale up, the item was selling like a hot dog. We posted a few Request For Quotation on Alibaba and got some quotations and here are my learnings.\n\n* **You will get the same product for less.**\n\nThe item we were getting for $7.80 was available for as low as $4.00 if we ordered in bulk, and as high as $10, so it varies. If you order $10K units then it will be available for $2.00. The more volume you ask for the lesser the cost will be - I mean it's normal, but the cost can go very low. I mean compare $7.80 to $2.00\n\n* **You will have to do your own quality check.**\n\nAlibaba is not like Amazon where they do the quality check for you, you will have to do your quality check before you ship the items to your customers. We ordered 10K and got around 300 defective items from the supply. (either they were broken, or of a bad quality). And then you have to send them to the supplier, the supplier will usually ask you to send the items back but it's not worth the time. So make sure that you order at least 10% more of what you need.\n\n* **Plan your shipments accordingly and choose the correct method**\n\nUnrelated to the store, we saw a great kitchen product that we thought could do really good in the American market, but the problem? It was 1.2Kgs. It was a really large item made out of stainless steel. We wanted it faster but AIR CARGO was expensive (it was charging $2000) as we did not have time since Q4 was already around the corner, however the affordable option was ship containers but the transit time was 1 month. So make sure if you plan to order large items, do it beforehand and make sure you choose the right shipping service to save costs.\n\n* **Trust your negotiation skills.**\n\nYou got to trust your negotiations skills and don't be shy when negotiating with your suppliers, we got down the per product cost from $6 to $4.80. While it may not seem a lot but it saved around $3500 per order. So negotiation works! I mean just like any other business.\n\n* **Never ditch a supplier too early.**\n\nIf you find a better price somewhere then don't move your orders at once, we got a supplier that was giving the exact same product for almost 20% less, and ordered 500 units from them. Most of the units were defective, so always maintain multiple suppliers until you do the quality check of both of the suppliers.\n\n* **Have multiple modes of communication**\n\nIf you're using Alibaba chat to communicate with your suppliers then make sure you have their emails and WhatsApp, WeChat or anything they use because they will go offline without prior notice.\n\n* **You will get free FedEX/UPS shipping**\n\nDon't hesitate to ask for premium shipping if you maintain a good relationship, the supplier we had used to send the items using ePacket which used to take 10-14 days, talked to the supplier and he offered a premium FedEX shipping for large orders which delivered the order in 4-5 days max (to California)\n\n* **Always use AliBaba Payment Gateway**\n\nNever use PayPal, or WeChat or anything else to send the funds, it's just not worth the hassle. Even though you have the escrow services at place. I would just avoid PayPal or anything and just go with Alibaba's gateway. It is seamless and has a great grievance redressal system.\n\n* **Product Sourcing Agents are great but be careful**\n\nThere are a lot of product sourcing agents are great, they will get in touch directly with the manufacturer for you and can get any type of customisation done for you and can get you better prices. But be careful and use a better sourcing agent.\n\nI guess that was it. I will edit this post if I find more points to address.",

Lately, I\u2019ve become really curious about international trade, especially how small businesses in the US manage to import products from China.\n\n\n\nA bit of context: many of my friends from high school and college (some still in China) are running \u201cinternational trade\u201d businesses. To be honest, it\u2019s quite surprising to me, because most of them don\u2019t speak much English or have any background in manufacturing or supply chains. From what I\u2019ve gathered, they mostly find local Chinese products and resell them via platforms like Alibaba and Amazon.\n\n\n\nThis got me thinking\u2014how do small businesses based in the US (who are far from the source) handle product quality, customs, and communication with suppliers? Big companies have teams, lawyers, and huge purchase volumes to leverage, but small businesses seem to face more uncertainty and risk in cross-border trade.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re a small business owner or have experience sourcing from China, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. How do you make it work? Do you use sourcing agents? How do you manage quality control remotely? Any insights or stories would be greatly appreciated.",

Some suppliers are open to private label, but the MOQ is still a bit high for testing.\n\nIf you're selling <$10 products:\n- How do you balance packaging cost with perceived value?\n- Have you found any budget-friendly packaging strategies that still look professional?\n- Do you repack in-house or use a 3PL?\n\nThanks again \u2014 this sub has been incredibly helpful.

I just got the order today (1 month later than I was supposed to).\n\nThe order is extremely poor quality. Most, if not all, units cannot be sold. The supplier is registered for Trade Assurance, but the funds were unfrozen before I could even open the box today.\n\nNow the supplier is offering $650 after I requested a full refund. I\u2019m sure Alibaba would be on my side if it escalated, but I\u2019m worried because my funds were already released for some reason. I told the supplier I would accept a $1300 refund and lose the shipping cost, but they are refusing.\n\nBefore the order was placed, I had sent them an extremely detailed set of requirements and instructions. I then made them send me an invoice that states the order will follow everything in the instructions. I have proof that the instructions were not followed.\n\nAm I screwed here or what?",

When I ask why, they tell me they gave me higher quality product price or they had upgraded the product. For example, somebody gave me $10 per unit for order of 100 or more for a product listed at $6.50 per unit for order of 100 or more. She proceeded to tell me because the listed price is lower quality using nylon and she quoted me the price for high quality fabric velous.

You can answer questions like:\n\n* **Who makes Bass Pro Shop's 4 Burner Gas Griddle?** Answer: NINGBO HUIGE OUTDOOR PRODUCTS\n* I thinking of buying barbells from a company I found on Alibaba called Nantong Leeton Fitness Co., the #1 ranking company on Alibaba for the term \"barbell\". **Is Nantong Leeton Fitness Co. the right supplier?** Answer: No. They are a big company but primarily sell resistance bands & foam rollers. They are likely outsourcing their heavy metal work creating a more costly product for you and you're more likely to have quality issues as well.\n* **Who are the top companies & suppliers who import/export under HS Code 42.02.92 -- trunks & suitcases?**\n* **Who are the top companies & suppliers who import/export under HS Code 42.02.92 out of Indonesia?**\n\nI want to thank the 600+ redditors from r/Entrepreneur who gave feedback on ImportYeti. It made a crazy difference. It really helped me understand how people actually use the tool and what needed to change about it. I added every major(but still possible) request that was mentioned during our closed beta test including hs-code/hts-code functionality(I'm really interested in feedback on this in particular), various search filters, address search (so you can try to find companies importing under different names), did multiple passes de-duping the company names (still needs some work, but a lot better), completely rewrote our search algorithm and fixed 100+ bugs & usability issues.\n\n**Even though I'm allowing puiblc access this time, I'd still love any and all feedback (love or hate)... no matter how brutal : ) I only want to create things that people really love. If you enjoyed this tool, have any ideas for how to improve it, or found a bug/usability issue, I want to hear from you. Please PM me or comment below anytime**",

In my case, we've signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), clearly stating that my product should not be disclosed to anyone. I am currently in the process of applying for a patent in Canada, the US, and China.\n\nNow, here's the dilemma: my supplier has suggested applying for the patent on my behalf, but he's requesting my passport number. I'm feeling skeptical about this. What do you think? Should I provide him with my passport ID so he can proceed with the patent application, or is it too risky? I would appreciate hearing your thoughts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you.",

      "content": "I always thought I sucked at sales.\n\nGot my first job as a telemarketer when I was 16, and I quit 6 hours into my first shift.\n\nIt was emotionally exhausting and I honestly felt disgusted.\n\nThis experience scarred me for years and held me back when I started building my freelancing business 8 years later.\n\nThen I joined an absurdly expensive mastermind ($7500 / 3 months) where they shared the initial version of the script I'm about to share with you.\n\nAnd it flipped my entire mindset about what it takes to sell on its head.\n\nInstead of being salesy, they told me to act like a doctor. Diagnose and then confidently present the cure.\n\nAfter I started doing this, I closed 200+ deals for my freelancing business. From big tech companies all the way down to small mom-and-pop online stores.\n\nHere's the script that changed everything for me:\n\n# The mindset\n\nBefore we get into the \"what to say,\" we need to fix the \"how to think.\" This is 90% of the battle.\n\n* Your job isn't to push a product; it's to diagnose a problem. You should be listening, asking intelligent questions, and determining **if you're even the right person to help them**. If a doctor listened to your symptoms for 30 seconds and immediately tried to sell you on a specific surgery, you'd run. Don't be that person.\n* In the first half of the call, the client should be doing 80% of the talking. If you're talking more than them, you're pitching, not discovering. You're losing.\n* You don't\u00a0need\u00a0this client. You are evaluating\u00a0them\u00a0just as much as they are evaluating you. Think of it like a first date. You're not trying to force a second date from the moment you sit down. You're genuinely trying to see if there's a connection and if you're compatible for a long-term relationship.\n* Do not read this word-for-word. Reading makes you sound like a robot and breaks all trust.\n\n# Preparation\n\nGood prep is going to be the source of your confidence. Knowing your questions and your offer ahead of time frees up your mental energy to actively listen.\n\n1. Go through the steps below and write down 3-5 specific questions for each section.\n2. **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Prepare 1-3 clear service packages with prices**. Even if you won\u2019t be able to pitch a productized service, this will help you quickly and without hesitation answer ANY questions regarding your pricing (e.g. \"I've done similar projects for around $4.000). This makes you look like someone who\u2019s been doing this for years, is a professional and even **allows you to close the deal on the call** instead of letting the momentum die with a \"let me get back to you with a proposal.\"\n\n**The biggest mistake most people make is to NOT talk about pricing.**\n\nTalking about pricing massively speeds up the sales process, because prospects can either accept your offer immediately, decline it, or try a delay tactic.\n\nIf they accept - then great!\n\nIf they decline or delay, you can ASK them why, and you\u2019ll find out a lot about the objections they have about working with you.\n\n# The warm-up\n\nSpending 2-3 minutes on small talk shows you\u2019re a relaxed, normal person, which helps the prospect relax, too.\n\n* What to Say:\n   * \u201cI see you're based in Austin. I've heard great things about the food scene there.\u201d\n   * \u201cI have to mention this, you picked the best Zoom background.\u201d\n   * \u201cGlad we could connect before the weekend. Any exciting plans?\u201d\n\nThen, transition and set the frame. This is crucial for taking control.\n\n* \"Awesome! Well, I\u2019m excited to chat. Should we dive right in?\"\u00a0(Wait for \"yes\")\n* \"Great. So the way I usually run these calls is I'll start by asking a few questions to get a really clear picture of your business and what you're looking for. If it sounds like I can definitely help, I\u2019ll explain how I work. Sound good?\"\n\n# Discovery\n\nThis is your \"doctor\" phase. Start broad and then go deep.\n\n* **If they reached out to you:**\u00a0\"So, to start, I\u2019d love to hear what prompted you to book this call today? What\u2019s going on in your business?\"\n* **If you reached out to them:**\u00a0\"When I reached out, something in my message must have clicked. What was it that made you decide to take this call?\"\n\nNow, shut up and listen. Take notes. After their initial answer, dig deeper with your prepared, service-specific questions.\n\n* **Pro-Tip:**\u00a0If they give short, unhelpful answers, use this:\u00a0**\"Could you tell me a bit more about that?\"**\n\n# Their experience\n\nAre you talking to a seasoned pro or a total beginner? The answer dictates how you'll pitch later on and what kind of questions to ask.\n\n* \"Have you tackled this issue before? What worked or didn\u2019t work?\"\n* \"Have you worked with another freelancer or agency on this? What was that like?\"\n\nThis tells you what they value, what they hate, and what landmines to avoid. If they say their last designer was a \"terrible communicator,\" you know to highlight your communication process in your pitch.\n\nOn the other hand if they tell you they've had 20 freelancers on this and that they all sucked, you should probably run away.\n\n# Defining success\n\nThis is where you move from their\u00a0problems\u00a0to their\u00a0aspirations.\n\n* \"Okay, let's fast forward 6 months. If we were to work together on this, what would need to have happened for you to feel like this was a huge success?\"\n* \"What would achieving \\[their goal\\] actually do for your business? Why is this a priority right now?\"\n\nWhen they answer this, they are literally selling\u00a0themselves\u00a0on the value of your service. Write down their exact words.\n\n# Uncovering roadblocks\n\nWhy their problem still exists. This is the bridge to your pitch.\n\n* \"So you\u2019re looking to achieve \\[their goal\\]. What\u2019s held you back from getting this done on your own so far?\"\n* \"Why do you think you haven't found the right person to help with this yet?\"\n\nTheir answer here is pure gold. It gives you the exact angle for your pitch.\n\n* If they say \"I don't have the time,\" your solution is about a hands-off, \"done-for-you\" process.\n* If they say \"I don't have the expertise,\" your solution is about your deep knowledge and strategic guidance.\n\n# The pitch\n\nSee how late this comes? You should only pitch after you fully understand their situation.\n\n* **Ask for permission:** \"Okay, based on everything you've told me, I have a very clear picture of the situation. I'm confident I can help you achieve \\[Their Goal\\]. Would it be okay if I walk you through how I'd approach it?\"\n* **Frame it:**\u00a0\"Great. So I specialize in helping \\[businesses like them\\] to \\[achieve the exact goal they just told you\\].\"\n* **Show proof:**\u00a0\"For example, last quarter I worked with \\[Similar Client\\], who was struggling with \\[Similar Problem\\]. We implemented this process and they were able to \\[Achieve Result\\].\"\n* **Explain the process:**\u00a0Walk them through the steps.\n   * \"First, we\u2019d start with a kickoff session to...\"\n   * \"Next, I\u2019ll prepare xyz to...\"\n   * \"Finally, you\u2019ll get...\"\n\n**IMPORTANT:** DO NOT REVEAL YOUR PRICING OR PACKAGES AT THIS POINT! Focus solely on the workflow and deliverables.\n\nAfter you're done, ask them:\n\n*  \"That\u2019s the general overview. What questions do you have about that for me?\"\n\nWhen they run out of process questions, they will almost always ask the big one: \"So... how much does it cost?\" This is the moment you've been waiting for.\n\n* \"The cost for the package I just described is $7,500.\"\n\nState your price clearly and confidently. Then, the most important part:\n\n**BE SILENT.**\n\nDo not justify it. Do not explain it. Do not say \"but we can be flexible.\" The first person who talks, loses. Let them react. Their reaction tells you everything you need to know.\n\n# Handling objections\n\nAn objection is not a \"no.\" It's a request for more information or reassurance. Don't get defensive. You can't handle an objection if you don't know what they're thinking. So your first job is to figure out what they're trying to say.\n\n**\"That's more expensive than I was expecting\"**\n\n* \"I understand. Can I ask what you were budgeting for a project like this?\"\u00a0OR\u00a0\"Could you tell me a bit more about what makes it feel expensive?\"\u00a0(This helps you understand if it's a value problem or a cash flow problem).\n\n**\"I need to think about it.\"**\n\n* \"That\u2019s perfectly fine; most of my best clients take time to think. Just so I can understand, what specific part of it do you need to think about most?\"\n\n**\"Why would I pay this much when I can get someone on Fiverr for $500?\"**\n\n* \"That's a fair question. You're right, there are definitely cheaper options out there, and for simple tasks, they can be great. The question is, are you looking to buy a task, or are you looking to buy a business outcome? A task-doer will do exactly what you say. I see my role as a strategic partner to help you achieve \\[their goal\\]. Which of those is more important to you right now?\"\n\n(I've got more objections and how to handle them in the google docs I'm linking below)\n\n# The close\n\nIf they agree with your price and want to move forward, you're not done yet. You need to handle the final step professionally.\n\n* Immediately explain the next steps.\u00a0\"Great! Here\u2019s what will happen next. I'm going to send over the contract and an invoice for the initial deposit. Once that's handled, I'll send you a link to book our kickoff call.\"\n* Don't just hang up after that! Spend 2-3 minutes returning to small talk. This calms their nerves, eases potential buyer's remorse, and reinforces that you're a human they're building a relationship with, not just a vendor who got their money.\n\n# Extra info\n\nI've put some extra objection handling examples, more info, more examples, etc. into a Google Doc which I'm linking in a comment below, to keep this post on point.  \n  \nThis all takes practice to master so I also created a ChatGPT Monster prompt that will roleplay different levels of clients (easy to hard). I'm also including it at the bottom of the doc.  \n",

      "content": "Hey /r/entrepeneur Cory here from Woodies.   **Thanks for the Gold!**\n\nI just read the post about some guy un-subbing because of all the click-bait, shit-posts, so now that he's gone, I thought I'd contribute really helpful content!\n\nWhile making this list, I cannot believe how many freaking services I use, it's kind of ridiculous, I probably need to cancel a few.  \n\nI've been running Woodies for 5 years now, and my vision has become clear.  I want to make as much money as possible while maintaining complete control of my business.  I have no employees, I have no partners.  I'm on track to *hopefully* do a million in revenue this year.\n\nI'm looking for anything that saves me time.  I'm a graduate of the four-hour workweek school of thought and my goal is to outsource everything I can, and automate everything that allows me to multiply my efforts.  \n\nHere is the full list of apps and SaaS that I use to run Woodies:\n\n[***Shopify***](http://shopify.com):  The alpha dog in the ecommerce space\n\n***Shopify Apps***:\n\n***[Login with Amazon](https://apps.shopify.com/login-with-amazon)***:  60% of traffic comes from mobile but only 20% of checkouts, why?  Because it's hard to enter your info, this allows people to login with their Amazon account, choose their address, choose their payment method and boom they're checked out.  Great app\n\n***[Make an Offer](https://apps.shopify.com/make-an-offer)***:  Exit-intent pop-up that allows customers to submit an offer for a product they wanted, they give their email, I use Zapier to shoot them a discount code and to add their email to Mailchimp\n\n***[ShopiMap](https://apps.shopify.com/shopimap)***:  It puts a pin on every customer and shows what they ordered.  Great for social proof.  [Here's mine for Woodies](https://woodies.com/pages/who-wears-woodies)\n\n***[CovetPics](https://apps.shopify.com/covet-pics)***:  Cool Instagram plug-in that makes a collage from my Instagram account and integrates the photos on each product page\n\n[***Yotpo***](http://yotpo.com):  I was lucky to get them while they cost $30/month  now it costs like $300 a month to collect reviews.  It's a really great app though, it auto-sends review requests and displays them on product pages.  I wish they picked a better name, Yotpo is kinda lame\n\n***[Spently](https://apps.shopify.com/spently)***:  I use them for sending out sweet order confirmation emails. The default ones from Shopify are pretty boring, these are awesome, shout to Nick!\n\n***[Compass.Co](http://compass.co)***:  The best ecommerce analytics I've seen, they integrate with all my sales channels and pull in more information than I knew I had and organize it neatly\n\n[***Amazon:***](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/homepage.html)  My number one sales platform, responsible for over 60% of my sales\n\n***Customer Service***:  This is VERY IMPORTANT.  Luckily, I pay my mom a monthly rate to perform this valuable service.  ([*thanks mom!*](https://woodies.com/pages/contact))  Unfortunately, you can't use her!  You CAN use someone else's mom however, the website [HireMyMom](https://www.hiremymom.com/) (queue all the reddit jokes)  We all know mom's are awesome, they're usually consistent, reliable, and friendly.  For VA's, mom's are #1\n\n[***AmazonFBA***](https://services.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon/benefits.htm):  The service that receives, stores, packs, and ships 100% of my products.  Without this service, I wouldn't be able to travel full-time, I'd need to rent a warehouse, hire workers, and the rest\n\n***[Amazon Affiliates](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/welcome)***:  I sell on Shopify and Amazon, but I understand there are people out there who just LOVE Amazon Prime, so they go to my site, find a product they like, then want to buy it Amazon, I don't blame them, I would prefer free shipping also.  SO on each of my product pages, I include a link to my product listing on Amazon, I use an affiliate link so that I make like 1% of the order.  It adds up to only like $100/month, but it's better than nothing.  ***See an example: [Woodies Zebrawood Sunglasses](https://woodies.com/collections/bamboo-wood-sunglasses/products/zebra-wood-aviator-wrap-sunglasses)*** *warning: affiliate link on next page*\n\nAmazon Apps:\n\n[***FeedbackGenius***](https://www.feedbackgenius.com/):  Sends automatic feedback requests to hundreds of orders per day, reviews are so valuable on Amazon that this app pays for itself many times over\n\n***[HelloProfit](http://helloprofit.com)***:  I started realizing how many different services I use and I went in a cancelled this one, $79 a month just to make the reports section of Amazon look better, not worth it\n\nWebsite:  \n\n[***Cloudflare***](https://www.cloudflare.com):  Supposedly makes my website faster, I have no idea honestly how this works, might be wasting $20/month, can anyone chime in here??  \n\n***[Typeform](http://typeform.com)***:  Awesome way to use forms.  I use them to collect information from giveaways.  \n\n***[Zapier](http://zapier.com)***:  Works well with Typeform to transfer data in between services like Gmail - Typeform - GoogleDocs - Mailchimp - Shopify.  Example, customer buys thing, Shopify tells Gmail, Gmail sends Email with Typeform, Shopify tells Mailchimp, Mailchimp adds to segment, Customer fills out Typeform, Typeform tells Mailchimp to send out Gmail, wait what?  It gets complicated\n\n***[GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com)***:  Probably not the best out there, but whatever it works fine, never had a problem\n\nTask Management:\n\n***[Gmail](http://gmail.com)***: I try to only check it twice a day, and my absolute goal is [Inbox Zero](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/inbox-zero)\n\n*Pro-tip*  [Learn all the Gmail keyboard shortcuts](https://www.shortcutworld.com/en/mac/Gmail.html)  \n\n*Pro-tip 2*  Enable Send+Archive in Gmail Settings and set it up to automatically open your next email\n\n[***Inbox Pause***](http://inboxpause.com/):  Helps me stick to my twice a day 'batching' of emails.  Pauses my email flow after I enable it.  This is to prevent that nasty habit of working on a tough task, then switching to gmail so I can answer 2-3 'easy' emails\n\n***[Trello](http://Trello.com)***:  In my never-ending pursuit of Inbox Zero, I have rules for when I encounter a batch of emails:\n\n* If I can respond within 1-2 minutes, I respond\n\n* If it would take me more than 2 minutes, I create a task on Trello\n\n***Gmail Timer Logs:***  Automatically starts a timer whenever I open a new email\n\n***Chrome Extensions:***\n\n***[LastPASS](http://lastpass.com)***:  Saves all my passwords, auto-login, and form-fills my payment methods. Pro-tip: save info from one CC to use online only and then cut it up, nothing is more frustrating than losing my card at the bar and having to reset 20 different subscriptions\n\n[***Block Site***](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh?hl=en):  The best website blocker I've used.  Simple, works, and enough of a pain to disable that I usually don't bother\n\n[***The Great Suspender***](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg?hl=en):  When I work, I usually have 15-20 tabs open at a time, this suspends the background tabs so the open ones run faster\n\n***[AMZ Seller Browser](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amz-seller-browser/klgpelgeohjghmccooegimcfhanlnngc?hl=en)***:  Let's me easily see Price History and Sales Rank on Amazon to help me keep track of competition\n\n***[Alexa Traffic](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/alexa-traffic-rank/cknebhggccemgcnbidipinkifmmegdel?hl=en)*** + ***[Similarweb](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/similarweb-website-rankin/hoklmmgfnpapgjgcpechhaamimifchmp?hl=en)***:  Helps me quickly assess how much traffic any site gets.  Also a quick way to check page loading speed\n\n***[OpenVid](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/openvid-screen-mic-and-ca/liecbddmkiiihnedobmlmillhodjkdmb)***:  A quick way to record a screencast so you can show a designer exactly what you want fixed and not have to setup a whole screenshare\n\nProduct Development:\n\n***[Alibaba](http://Alibaba.com)***:  Still my first stop when it comes to searching for new products.  Just message suppliers asking them to email you back.  1. This avoids Alibaba's terribly designed messaging system  2.  This filters out suppliers who cannot follow simple instructions\n\n[***Whatsapp***](http://whatsapp.com):  Once you start working with a supplier, get them on whatsapp, Chinese tend to prefer messaging over email and I consider this my most important business relationship, so it's worth it\n\n[***Flexport***](http://flexport.com):  Not sure if they're accepting new members again yet, makes international freight forwarding as easy as ordering pizza\n\n[***Upgraded Images***](http://upgradedimages.com):  Ken at Upgraded Images is my go-to guy for getting great product photography that stands out.  Quick, affordable, and quality stuff\n\n[***SpeedyBarcodes***](https://speedybarcodes.com/):  Where I buy barcodes so I can sell on Amazon\n\nMarketing:\n\n***[Schedugram](http://schedugr.am)***:  Allows me to schedule Instagram posts in advance and have them automatically post (the only tech that does that automatically I believe)\n\n***[Repost](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/repost-for-instagram/id570315854?mt=8)***:  Repost other Instagram photos, usually of people who tag Woodies in a photo\n\n***[Instagram](http://instagram.com)*** and ^^[Snapchat](http://snapchat.com):  Can we all agree that Instagram is king and Snapchat has been demoted to court jester?  Here's my personal Instagram:  [WoodiesCaptain](http://instagram.com/woodiescaptain) and the [Woodies IG](http://instagram.com/woodies), if you're interested\n\n*also good for hitting up your WCW, just sliiiiiide in the DM and see if she'll post a pic*\n\n[***Mailchimp***](http://mailchimp.com):  Been using them for 4 years to send out emails, I send out really simple emails so I could probably downgrade to something else.  I'm also considering [***Klaviyo***](https://www.klaviyo.com/) because it's built specifically for Shopify. \n\nApps:\n\n[TripIt](http://tripit.com):  I travel full-time (don't have a home) so this keeps track of all my itineraries\n\n[***F.lux***](https://justgetflux.com/):  Dims my screen at night to give my eyes a break while I work late *highly recommended*\n\n***[Franz](http://meetfranz.com/)***:  Messaging app for Mac that combines Whatsapp, Messenger, Hangouts, Slack, Skype, and WeChat all in one easy to use client\n\nNot a fan:  StitchLabs, Shipwire, AppSumo is suddenly not my favorite app mostly because I can't figure it out, apps should just WORK or GTFO\n\nWhat apps or SaaS am I missing??\n\nps.  I don't have an app for this but I'm a HUGE fan of saying NO to people.  No, I don't sell wholesale. No, I don't ship internationally. No creates space for you to think clearly about what you really want.  No opens up time to work on truly important work\n\nI'll stick around to answer any questions, you can also PM me, or email Cory@Woodies.com \n\nSee you at the beach!\n\nCory Stout\n\nCaptain, [Woodies](https://woodies.com)",

      "title": "Alibaba Hacks: The most efficient way to find suppliers on the biggest sourcing website",
      "content": "After releasing the [Import Bible (64 pages free ebook on sourcing)](http://importdojo.com) some people wanted to know my workflow how I use Alibaba to cut down the time to find quality suppliers.\n\nI made a [20 minute screencast](http://importdojo.com/alibaba-hacks/) you can watch over here or for the basic outline of what I do, simply read below.\n\nFor the general sourcing workflow have a look at my previous [case study I posted on /r/entrepreneur few weeks ago here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/34x4l5/case_study_importing_a_power_bank_from_china_all/)\n\n**Today you want to source for an action camera, similar to the GoPro cameras.**\n\nYou can start by going to the main page of Alibaba.com and input **\u201caction camera\u201d** in the search option.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/TAfSglm\n\nOk, so you found 106,946 products. At this point you want to filter your results for the most relevant suppliers. You will definitely want the suppliers to be:\n\n**Gold suppliers:**\n\nThis is a paid membership from Alibaba for the supplier. They get featured and can put up a lot more items in their catalogue (among other functions).\n\n**Onsite Checked:**\n\nThe onsite operation of the factory has been checked by Alibaba and a third party confirmed its legal existence.\n\n**Assessed suppliers:**\n\nThis is a third-party assessment usually done through a testing company to verify various parts of the company. This includes machinery, staff, engineers, workers, certification, and much more.\n\nAfter you have filtered for this you are down to 8,258 products:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/tv8C48r\n\n**Insider tip:**\n\nNow you filter down to the relevant manufacturing province. Why? Because each province in China is specific for different product categories.\n\nIf you find a few suppliers (compared to hundreds in other provinces) on Alibaba in a certain region it is almost 100% certain they are a trading company. They either buy this certain product from somewhere else to round up their product catalogue (95% in all cases) or they are really manufacturing it.\n\nBut even if they are manufacturing it in their region they are likely less attractive in terms of prices, less experienced in manufacturing this product and their raw material suppliers are also somewhere far away. Ultimately making them less competitive.\n\nThere are several reasons why you will find suppliers for a specific product settled within a province.\n\n* The infrastructure for this product is good. Meaning there are a lot of suppliers in the area supplying components for the suppliers end-product\n* The workers in this area are skilled in producing this specific product. Making it easier to manufacture the end-product. Most likely, this also improves the overall quality.\n* The province has favourable tax rates for the factory on certain products.\nNow lets look at this again. Even though you didn\u2019t know the province and where the product is mainly manufactured you can get some insights on this very easily:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Nz546Eg\n\nGuangdong province has a total of 7,766 suppliers for this product. The other provinces have only a few. So you filter by this province.\n\nNow, you are looking to buy small quantities, lets say 10 pieces to start. You can filter the supplier by MOQ now:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Ctt6PcF\n\nNow lets look at the specific suppliers. You scroll down and by hovering over the Gold supplier symbol you will see quick facts. You are basically looking for a factory that has experience in your market. This specific supplier has experience in North America, Western & Eastern Europe.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/4hP6OFi\n\n**Insider tip:**\n\nYou will want a supplier who has experience in these markets because he is probably aware of specific country requirements & regulations.\nThis helps because he may already have applied for certificates for this product that you need when importing.\n\nNow look at the product page. What does the page tell you?\n\nhttp://imgur.com/hNs5zmX\n\nYou will find the following:\n\n* Supplier has 5 year \u201cGOLD\u201d membership, which is a good sign. If he had scammed someone before Alibaba would have deleted his account and not renewed it for 5 years.\n* Price is within a reasonable range\n* Your desired MOQ can be met (10 pieces)\n* Payment terms are acceptable. I would go for PayPal at this amount.\n* The company is rather young but that doesn\u2019t matter. These type of camera\u2019s got really popular around 2012 so a company that has been in that field prior to that has actually a lot of experience.\n\n**Insider tip: The trick here is to think outside the box.**\n\nDon\u2019t only look at a supplier and try to find some issue or problem. Think about the product too. Ask yourself questions such as \u201cdoes his product portfolio make sense\u201d? Is it in line with his other products? Or as for example the last point above, \u201cwhen did these things get popular\u201d?.\n\nNow when you scroll down there are several more good indicators. For example good product photos. **You will want a supplier that can send you high-resolution photos for your packaging or private label.**\n\nhttp://imgur.com/WmRb1Um\n\nYou will see available certifications. In this case what matters are **RoHS**, **CE** & **FCC**.\n\n**RoHs** certification is necessary for most European countries & the Americas. It prohibits certain hazardous material within the product.\n**CE** is a certification for Europe to meet general standards. Its good if a supplier has this\n**FCC** is a required certification on electrical products & also a standard for the US.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/nxdQZLx\n\nYou could already feel comfortable with this supplier, but you should check further on him in person by email.\n\nNext, click on the \u201ccontact details\u201d where you will find several things that help you to evaluate the supplier further.\n\nLook at the company profile and what you can find there.\n\nAlso look at the website outside Alibaba. If you cannot find his website outside Alibaba then google his company name and try to find it that way.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/20bfi7z\n\nWhen you look at the website, pay attention on what products they manufacture. If the seller advertises cameras on Alibaba and his main products outside Alibaba are pillows then you will know they are only trading the cameras and you should look for a new supplier at this stage.\n\nBut, this supplier has mainly cameras in their assortment. Looks good so far.\n\nWhat you notice is that their address is different than the one on Alibaba. At this stage it is probably their Hong Kong office that they use to invoice their customers. Many factories in China have a company in Hong Kong for tax and banking reasons. No need to be worried at this stage.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/CR0IOH1\n\nGoing back to Alibaba, you will want to contact the supplier with your request now. You need to sign in to Alibaba to send a message.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/l9Q1Y1f\n\nBasically you want to ask for a price, MOQ, delivery time and to which customers he is selling this item too. Obviously you also need to do routine checks on factory standards, product certifications and supplier profiles. If you would order from this factory later you should also look into having an inspection by a third-party.\n\nHere is what the inquiry could look like:\n\n*Hi\u2026,*\n\n*My name is \u2026.. and I am the \u2026.(Manager/President/Buyer etc.) of \u2026. Limited/Inc.*\n\n*We are a (fill in your company\u2019s business, e.g., Importer/Buying Office/Whole seller/Online shop) and are operating in (fill in your country).*\n*You can also check out our website: www. \u2026..*\n\n*I am writing you today to inquire about a product I saw on your website/catalogue/exhibition.*\n\n*Here is a link to the product I am looking for:*\n\n*http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Wifi-Sport-Camera-Wifi-Action-Camera_1880459810.html*\n\n*Could you please give me the following information:*\n\n*Unit price based on 10 Pieces*\n*Minimum Order Quantity*\n*Available certification (CE, RoHS, FCC, GS, etc.)*\n*Production lead time*\n*Available colors*\n*Payment terms*\n*You can fill in the details in the attached quotation format or send me your quotation in the first step. Then I will evaluate your offer and get back to* *you as soon as possible.*\n\n*If you have any questions please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me.*\n\n*Thanks and best regards,*\n\nYou should now repeat this step and send an inquiry to at least 3 more companies on Alibaba.\n\nIf he didn\u2019t follow up on all your questions make sure to email him back and ask again.\n\nFor example if you need to know about certifications and they didn\u2019t reply to that, ask them.\n\n**Insider tip:**\n\nSometimes suppliers put all available certifications on Alibaba but they don\u2019t tell you that they charge extra for them. A RoHS, CE or FCC certification can cost from 200USD up.\n\nAsk to see copies of certificates.\n\n* Do the certificates match up with the article number that the supplier gave you? \u2014 > If not, ask about it\n* Is the certificate expired? \u2014 > If yes, ask if he would renew once order is placed.\n* Who issued the certificate? \u2014 > If it is a local Chinese company google them and see what you can find about their service.\n* If they don\u2019t have certificates yet, ask them if they could apply for them once you place an order.\n\nMake sure you tell them that you will not release any payments if the certificates are not available upon shipment. If you book an inspection company, make sure to instruct your inspection company to check on this.\n\nOnce you received the suppliers feedback it is time to follow up with him on samples.\n\nFor more details on how to order & test your samples properly check my other articles:\n[Here](http://importdojo.com/sample-communication-with-your-suppliers-an-in-depth-guide/)\n&\n[Here](http://importdojo.com/testing-your-samples/)\n\nOther tips for Alibaba:\n\n**AliSource Pro**\nThere is a rather new service called AliSource Pro. You can basically send quotation requests to thousands of suppliers.\n\nHere is what it looks like:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/9sgvuHo\n\nYou can input all product details and submit. Within a few hours you should have a couple of offers.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Xu1STHk\n\nThe downside to this is that there is not much filtering. Random suppliers will send you offers and some of them don\u2019t even match your inquiry. I suggest filling in as many details as possible and then going trough the whole process of filtering & scanning a supplier as described above.\n\n**Google the supplier**\n\nIf you cannot find much about the supplier on Alibaba, Google the suppliers name and see what you can find. Perhaps even try \u201csupplier name forums\u201d.\nThat way you maybe find something (positive or negative) in forums about the supplier.\n\nThese are the basics of sourcing on Alibaba, of course there is more to that. [I provide plenty of information for free on my blog](http://importdojo.com) that will get you started. There is no need to delay getting into this business, with all the tools available these days everyone can start importing from overseas and building their own brand.\n\n",

      "content": "It\u2019s hard to imagine successful companies struggling to acquire customers. We see the successes with their hordes of fans and we think, \u201cWow, they\u2019re so lucky. They have it good.\u201d\n\nYet every single behemoth in existence once had to court its first customer.\n\n[In this post](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/how-to-get-first-customers/), I feature some of their stories. You\u2019ll find in them a generous mix of grunt work, guts, and genius.\n\n**1 & 2: Tinder and Alibaba \u2013 physically traveled to their first users**\n\n*Tinder went from 5,000 to 15,000 users by getting sorority girls to signup on the spot*\n\nCrucial to [Tinder\u2019s success](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/how-tinder-obtained-more-than-50-million-users-through-word-of-mouth/) was then-CMO Whitney Wolfe\u2019s ideas for building an early user-base. She planned a tour that would take her to prominent college campuses around the country.\n\n- She would go to chapters of her sorority, do her presentation, and have all the girls at the meetings install the app.\n- Then she\u2019d go to the corresponding brother fraternity\u2014they\u2019d open the app and see all these cute girls they knew.\n- Tinder had fewer than 5,000 users before Wolfe made her trip. When she returned, there were some 15,000.\u201d\n\n*Alibaba \u201cbrute-forced\u201d its success by visiting factories one by one*\n\nBack in the early \u201900s,  Jack Ma sent out a large sales force to fan out across the country, visiting factories one by one to show them how they could use Alibaba and Taobao to sell stuff online.\n\nBack then, a large number of factories in China weren\u2019t used to working with other people online, and sometimes didn\u2019t even have computers or Internet.\n\nIt was hard work, but companies quickly flocked to Alibaba and its holdings. This allowed them to get an edge over eBay.\n\n**3 & 4: Quora and Reddit \u2013 seeded their sites with their own content**\n\n*Founders solved the chicken-and-egg problem by contributing the bulk of early content themselves*\n\n[Quora](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/quora-marketing-strategy/) and Reddit are two of the largest online forums in existence today, but they were once ghost towns with the chicken-and-egg problem of \u201cempty site = no users / no users = empty site\u201d.\n\nQuora co-founders D\u2019Angelo, Cheever and Cox wrote most of the earliest questions and answers themselves. The first employees and beta testers then continued this trend, until the platform generated enough activity for them to stop.\n\nReddit did the same, but it also created fake profiles. According co-founder Steve Huffman, it took several months before the front page would fill up organically without their submissions.\n\n**5 & 6: Threadless and Dropbox \u2013 the biggest believers in word-of-mouth**\n\n*Dropbox launched shared folders and a massive referral campaign*\n\nThe Dropbox empire was built on referrals.\n\n- With its massive word of mouth campaign, Dropbox grew its user base by 40 times \u2013 from 100,000 to 4,000,000.\n- In April 2010 alone, Dropbox users sent 2.8 million direct referral invites.\n- But on top of that, Dropbox itself was designed to encourage sharing. They introduced shared folders, a nifty feature that encouraged users to invite others to share access to folders.\n\n*Threadless let its community run their own initiatives*\n\nOne of Threadless\u2019 crucial early moves was to start a massive word-of-mouth campaign.\n\nFrom the get-go, [Threadless supported community](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/threadless-marketing-strategy/) initiated \u201crogue contests\u201d(spontaneous, themed tee shirt contests).\n\nIn turn, its community is insanely creative, and also fiercely loyal brand advocates.\n\n**7: Black Milk: Fashion + Fandoms = Great Success!**\n\nThe clothing store achieved its impressive growth by milking fandom for its worth. It didn\u2019t stop at making pop culture-inspired apparel \u2013 it established serious legitimacy by getting official license for all their geeky wear.\n\nIt\u2019s also made its Facebook page a fandom watering hole. Over there, dedicated \u201cSharkies\u201d can connect with like-minded fans.\n\nThere\u2019s even a Black Milk-approved group where girls can swap, buy, and sell their purchases with each other.\n\n**8: OKCupid \u2013 legendary content on OKTrends averaged 4,222 tweets per post**\n\nThe content on OKTrends was so mindblowingly insightful that people actually despaired when it was discontinued. Who wouldn\u2019t want to read and share this post titled \u201c10 Charts About Sex\u201c? (Do it, it\u2019s worth all your attention.)\n\nFrom August 2010 to April 2011, OkTrends posts averaged a staggering 32,500 Facebook likes and 4,222 tweets.\n\nCo-founder Rudder says, \u201cHonestly I think the blog\u2013one way or another\u2013has driven a lot of our growth. Certainly, it has driven brand awareness. It\u2019s been the only thing we\u2019ve ever done, other than making a great dating site, that has gotten us out there into the world.\u201d\n\n**9: Etsy \u2013 harvested interest by reaching out to target communities before launching**\n\n[Etsy founders](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/etsy-marketing-strategy/) used to run a web design shop and were working on getcrafty.com for one of their projects, during which they discovered the need for a marketplace for handmade crafts.\n\nSo, while they built Etsy, they reached out to the craft community on getcrafty.com and Craftster.org, which had an even larger user base.\n\nBy the time they launched, they already had a lot of interest generated among the two platforms, and that helped get the required inventory and start off transactions on Etsy.\n\n**10: Buffer \u2013 got to 100k users primarily through frequent guest blogging**\n\nCo-founder Leo Wildrich wrote 150 guest posts in the first 9 months of running Buffer, and he swears by it. That\u2019s 16-17 posts per month, or more than 1 every two days!\n\n\u201cRelationships are actually the most valuable things that you gain from guest posting. At the end of the day, if you do a lot of guest posting you simply make a lot of friends. I\u2019ve got great friends over at Treehouse, Social Media Examiner, SocialMouths, and other great sites. You provide someone with free content, that\u2019s a great favor if you think about it, so it\u2019s a great opportunity to make friends with these awesome people.\u201d\n\n**11: ASOS \u2013 the ecommerce store mailed its own print magazine to 400,000 customers**\n\nBack in 2006, CEO Nick Robertson insisted that the glossy print catalog was still key to making the brand an essential part of customers\u2019 lives. Today, besides maintaining a content-rich site, ASOS also has a magazine with a circulation of 456,000 \u2013 the 18th largest in the UK, immediately behind Glamour and Closer, and just a handful of places behind New.\n\nUnconditional, free shipping was irresistable.\n\nOne of the things that kept customers flocking to ASOS was its incredible shipping and returns policy \u2013 even in its early days, ASOS was shipping for free and without minimum purchase. That policy has only just recently changed, but ASOS already has a loyal fanbase worldwide.\n\n**12 & 13: Twitter and Foursquare \u2013 exploded their userbases at SXSW with guerrilla marketing**\n\n*SXSW 2007 \u2013 Twitter lived streamed the conference on huge plasma screens*\n\nCo-founder Evan Williams decided to visualize the service on 60 inch plasma screens in the hallways, because \u201cWe knew hallways were where the action was\u201d. Twitter created an event-specific feature that allowed attendees to follow a handful of \u201cambassadors\u201d.\n\nAccording to Newsweek\u2019s Steven Levy, \u201cHundreds of conference-goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters. Panelists and speakers mentioned the service, and the bloggers in attendance touted it.\u201d During the event, Twitter usage went from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000.\n\n*Foursquare \u2013 grew average check-ins from 250k to 350k with just chalk and rubber balls*\n\nFoursquare didn\u2019t have a booth like most other brands at the 2010 SXSW convention. Neither did it have Twitter\u2019s marketing budget (Twitter spent $11k on its SXSW campaign). Instead, it set up an actual game of \u201cfour square\u201d in front of the convention hall, which involved just chalk and two rubber balls.\n\nThe game drew thousands of walk-up participants [1], Said CEO Dennis Crowley, \u201cWe played all day long, and there was always a waiting line. We were handing out tee shirts, buttons, and stickers. Anytime someone didn\u2019t know what Foursquare was, we helped them find it on their phone. We helped get them up and running and using it.\u201d\n\n**14: Taskrabbit \u2013 focused on delighting moms in Boston**\n\nTaskrabbit first cornered the market with one mothers\u2019 group in Boston\n\nTaskrabbit is similar to Uber in its hyperlocal focus. Leah Busque talked about Taskrabbit\u2019s early traction in response to a question \u201cHow did you acquire your first 10,000 users?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can be tempting to just go really broad, really wide scale, really fast. But for us, we just focused on a customer segment. We focused on this mothers\u2019 group in Boston. And once we had cornered that market with that moms\u2019 group, those moms were talking to other moms on Beacon Hill and Backbay and Cambridge and it just spread from there.\u201d\n\n**15: Airbnb \u2013 shuttled from coast to coast to talk to their first users**\n\n*Founders went the extra mile for their earliest users*\n\nFounders Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk and Joe Gebbia acted on Paul Graham\u2019s advice in their Y Combinator days and \u201cdid things that didn\u2019t scale\u201d. Specifically, they went to NYC to acquire their earliest users, then followed up with them extensively.\n\n\u201cWhen New York took off, we flew back every weekend. We went door to door with cameras taking pictures of all these apartments to put them online. I lived in their living rooms. And home by home, block by block, communities started growing. And people would visit New York and bring the idea back with them to their city.\u201d \u2013 Brian Chesky, for The Atlantic\n\n\u201cBecause of the Democratic National Conventions, some people were using the site in New York and listing places. We would reach out to the very few people we had and get to know them, figure out what products they needed and what we could offer them. We tried to build loyalty knowing that if we did that, they would tell their friends. We\u2019d host parties and meetups and all sorts of different things. \n\nThrough that process, they\u2019d get very excited and tell their friends about Airbnb. It was mostly about generating as much buzz and excitement to get them to tell their friends about us.\u201d \u2013 Chesky, Startups Open-sourced\n\n*Airbnb believed in generating word-of-mouth, which would attract the press, which would generate more word-of-mouth*\n\n\u201cWe never dressed up in gorilla suits but we passed out fliers in coffee shops, train stations\u2014we did all sorts of things. I don\u2019t know what tactics worked more than others, but I think press was always the number one tactic for us. The press would spark another group of users, then we\u2019d go visit those people and talk to them and get them excited. It was a pattern that repeated itself.\u201d \u2013 Chesky, Startups Open-sourced\n\n**16: Yelp \u2013 grew a loyal user base by rewarding quality reviews**\n\n*Gave \u201cKudos\u201d for good behavior*\n\nYelp wanted to create a tight community of consistent reviewers and high quality reviews. It rightly guessed that people were more likely to write in-depth, well crafted reviews when their names appeared alongside them. So it offered special recognition to users who were first to review a business, and let other users give kudos for reviews that are useful, funny, or cool.\n\nAnd the numbers in 2006 show that most Yelp reviewers got hooked on the site:\n\nUsers who contributed 6 or more reviews:\n\nCitySearch \u2013 4.8%\nYahoo Local \u2013 11.1%\nYelp \u2013 65.8%\nUsers who left only one review:\n\nCitySearch \u2013 71.2%\nYahoo Local \u2013 56.4%\nYelp \u2013 9.2%\n\n*Treated their best \u201cElite\u201d users generously*\n\nThe most engaged Yelp users are elevated to \u201cElite\u201d status, visible by a shiny Elite badge on their account profile. By 2006, a full 44% of reviews on the site were contributed by Yelp Elite. \n\nDave Kim, a six-year Yelp Elite user with over 900 reviews, explains:\n\n\u201cYelp does a good job of finding ways to reward people, not through monetary means, but little perks \u2026 At regular Yelp Events, Elites often got first-chance to RSVP and even got in an hour before everyone else. There are specific events just for Yelp Elite that offer free food and drinks and swag.\u201d\n\n**17: Groove \u2013 reached out to the customers that \u201cgot away\u201d**\n\nCEO Alex Turnbull has written a very detailed analysis of Groove\u2019s early customer acquisition tactics, along the theme of doing things that don\u2019t scale. The tactic that stood out the most was scrapping \u2013 reaching out to customers who chose other competitors, and sincerely asking the reasons for their choice. From the exercise, Turnbull discovered and fixed several bugs, and convince customers to give Groove another chance.\n\n\n",

      "title": "I became a self made millionaire at 25 in a third world country. I will share my story here:",
      "content": "I am from Central America, a tropical region with lots of poverty and problems.\nSince I was a kid, I had the drive to put extra effort on achieving something. I started selling bananas to construction workers at 7 later selling candy to schoolmates at 10.\n\nAt 15 I decided to study business and become either an over achiever employee or a business owner, at that time I didn\u2019t exactly know which path to take.\nWhile I was in university (BA studies), I noticed I had a lot of spare time after school, so instead of wasting my time on leisure, I decided to start a business, I had no clue of which kind of business start (also to start one that didn\u2019t require much money because I had none.) I met with fellow classmates that were smart and also wanted to stand out, so together we decided to start a coffee distribution company. \n\nWe were offering coffee to restaurants and hotels but competition was very tough and we just couldn\u2019t close deals to get to break even. I started noticing the first signs of a red ocean industry and how tough it is to stand out in that kind of industry. My cofounders were not putting the same effort as I was, and that frustrated me. At a point my dorm served as the company\u2019s warehouse, packing center and distribution center, I was closing almost all of the sales with clients and also doing the delivery. I noticed many companies offered high quality coffee but only a few offered high quality tea. Also in my region (a coffee growing region) there are a lot of coffee sellers as we live in a coffee growing country. Tea was always imported from Asia and few companies actually focused on it. I noticed there was an opportunity on focusing on tea, instead of coffee. \n\nI offered my cofounders to buy their shares and they agreed (for them it was a relief) so I started sourcing tea that was grown locally and mixing it with herbs, spiced and fruits to create tasty tea blends. The product was very good and without competitors, so I went to Mcdonald\u2019s HQ and offered the product for Mccafe. Mcdonald\u2019s loved the product and agreed on the price (they also liked that I was very young). My tea processing was being done at my dorm so I lacked all the licenses required to supply at Mcdonald\u2019s standards, so I was very sincere with the Supply Chain director and told him I had all the desire but lacked the money to build the proper tea facility. I offered him teapots and with the teapot earnings I could buy the machinery and equipment required to supply them properly and also to get the sanitary approvals. He agreed on the teapots and gave me a 50% advance ($50k) for them. I bought 5,000 teapots in Alibaba (China) for $3 each and sold them at $20 to Mccafe. I used all the profits to build the facility and it took me almost one year to finally start supplying Mcdonald\u2019s.\n\n\nWhile I was already supplying them, I noticed the tea market was very small (a Blue Ocean kind, but actually a blue pond) \nMy ambitious goals (become a billionaire at 35) would be tough to reach staying exclusively in the tea industry.\nI kept hustling for two years on the tea, until an opportunity came to me (or I came to it).\n\n\nWhile I was offering tea to a sushi restaurant, out of curiosity, asked if the fish served there was locally caught.\nThe owner said; \u201cNo, it comes from Asia because local fish has bad quality and I can\u2019t risk my restaurant\u2019s reputation or client\u2019s health giving them bad quality fish.\u201d\n\nIt startled me that local restaurants didn\u2019t use local fish even though we have plenty access to both Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. Seemed like an obvious problem, so I started to find out why, what asians did right and what us, central americans did wrong.\n\nAfter months of obsessive research, the problem was lack of knowledge and investment in the local fishing industry resulting in fisherman living in poverty conditions with no ability to supply high quality fish. The solution was to teach them good practices and invest in a high quality seafood processing facility, the cost of the solution was over $400,000 in investment money that I didn\u2019t had.\n\n\nSo I decided to build a team, test out our theory and provide the product to restaurants and learn form their feedback. It was a lean start up mentality to start small and cheap to prove the business thesis. We received excellent feedback and real purchase interest from restaurants.\nThat was enough to know it was a great opportunity and also a huge market potential for growth.\nSo I decided to pitch my way up until I could secure the funds.\nAfter a year of pitching, I was far from the goal (securing $400k in a third world country is nearly impossible if you are a young entrepreneur with an idea.)\nSo I started enrolling in international entrepreneurship competitions, I was able to compete in GSEA and then Hult Prize. I didn\u2019t win them, (earned a 2nd place in both) but it was enough to broaden my network with wealthy investors with deep pockets. \n\nI secured funding early 2020 and started building the fish facility in February, the Covid lockdown hit us hard and we couldn\u2019t deliver what our investor expected.\nSo legal fights came, with lawyers I couldn\u2019t afford, while managing a born-dead company, while also pitching again to secure more funds to get us out of the hole.\nOur initial investor agreed to sell his shares if given 40% ROI, paid $150k up front and semestral payments for 5 years \n\nA new investment fund gave us a loan to pay back the previous investor and additional $300k for working capital. Very high interest rate, but at least we got a runway to prove our business through time.\n\nAfter restructuring and getting rid of internal and external bad apples, we started buying, processing and selling fish in May 2021, we closed 2021 with $2m in revenue and we will close 2022 with $10m revenue, beyond supplying fish to local restaurants we also provide fresh fish (airplane delivery) to restaurants in Miami, NY, LA, frozen fish to hotel chains all over America.\nWe have healthy debts now, a good EBITDA and a growth trajectory that will put us in $100m annual revenue in less than ten years, we will keep reinvesting profits on CAPEX and OPEX to keep up with the growth trajectory.\n\nGod has been an integral part of my journey.\n\nLessons learned:\n1. Vision and Goals must be clear.\n2. The path can change, the goals can\u2019t.\n3. Having a mission is key.\n4. Hustle, Hustle, Hustle\n5. Have a great team that compliment your strengths ad weaknesses.\n\nEdit: Some redditors don\u2019t believe this, so search for\n\u201cForbes Centroamerica Abril 2022\u201d 30 promesas de los negocios, you will see my face on the cover.\n\nNew edit:\nI will start providing proof of my story on my profile so all of you skeptics can believe, this isn\u2019t for me! It\u2019s for you!!! Human confidence and trust has brought humanity to great lengths, imagine that closed mentality was the same that kept cavemen from believing that human made fire wasn\u2019t sorcery.\n\nI hope you enjoyed my story!!!",

      "content": "Hello,\n\n*Not here to promote a trade company, a blog, or start-up business; I source and import all my products and sell them using my own sales channels.* I'm about to fly back (from LAX) to the motherland of cheap manufacturing for the Canton Fair and figured I could offer some suggestions.\n\n\n\n**About China:**\n\n* China is both the largest manufacturing base and one of the most culturally distinct places of the world.  China is crazy.\n\n\n\n* China is filled with factories, most of which barely know the end product for which they make parts for. Still they are integral to the manufacturing process and will do a great job if you know how to ask them to.\n\n\n\n* Most factories are dirty, have poor/sub-par working conditions, and are located in rural districts outside the of small cities. \nhttp://imgur.com/8tVTcKS,oILFeZq (making sofas)\nhttp://imgur.com/8tVTcKS,oILFeZq#1 (coating steel frames)\nIt's not the best place for hardcore humanitarian types to visit.\n\n\n\n**FAQ**\n\n* *Should I buy from company X on Alibaba?* Probably not. It's unlikely they are the actual manufacturer. They do not have the product in stock. If you negotiate down they will find a manufacturer to lessen the quality to retain their margin. Believe it or not, factories can be very loyal, so expect a battle if you want to dump your supplier and go straight to the mfg later on. \n\n* *Should I hire a sourcing company?* If you just need one part and are not really concerned about developing more business in China, go for it. Overall, I'm not too fond of these companies. They tend to rest on the fact you don't know what you're doing. I've met sourcing experts who have never left the comforts of their major city. \n\n* *OK, so how do I source a product then?* While there isn't a silver-bullet, find someone you trust. Build a relationship over small business. Make it mutually beneficial for your company to grow. There are certainly some very motivated individuals out there.\n\n* *How do I actually import my product?* Find a freight forwarding company, preferably one that has offices near both ports. They will arrange for trucking to port, ocean freight, customs brokerage, documentation, etc. Have multiple forwarders give you line item quotes to ensure you don't get ripped off. Realistically importing a 20' container into the US will be about $2.5k-$4k (+ any import duty). \n\n",

      "title": "I\u2019m $141,000 in Debt After Chasing Big Dreams. Sometimes, it\u2019s okay to give up",
      "content": "I honestly don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I\u2019ve spent years chasing big dreams, pouring everything I had\u2014money, energy, and hope\u2014into chasing success and working towards my goals and dreams. And now I\u2019m sitting here with 8 million pesos (about $141,000) in debt, questioning everything about myself. Why do I dream so big? Why do I keep thinking I can make it? Why can\u2019t I stop?\n\nIt all started in 2019 when I opened my first physical store. I started small, renting an exhibit space to test the market, and to my surprise, it worked. I was making 50,000 pesos (around $880) a month in profit(I was selling women and kids clothing imported from China). That little success felt like validation. I thought, \u201cThis is it!\u201d So, I went all in. I took out a 1 million peso loan (about $17,650) to open a full-scale store. Renovations, stocks\u2014it all felt like the right move.\n\nAnd then COVID hit. Everything shut down, and I was forced to try online. Since I had loans to pay, I had no choice. To my surprise, the online store took off. To think that people were stuck at home, who would buy clothes for going out at a time like this. But! It was became wildly profitable\u2014more than I could have imagined. In December 2020, I hit my biggest milestone: 400,000 pesos (around $7,060) in sales in just 24 hours. I thought I had finally made it. I believed it would always be like this, that this is just the beginning and it will only get better from here.\n\nSo, I doubled down. I secured another loan to increase stock, believing that the more I had, the more I\u2019d sell(this time I was only focusing on children\u2019s clothing and shoes since that is what sold out fast). I was so optimistic, so confident. But 2021 was different. Sales slowed, and I wasn\u2019t paying attention to the numbers. I wasn\u2019t tracking my profit margins or operational costs properly. I just kept pushing forward, thinking I could turn things around if I spent more on ads. I was wrong.\n\nThe debt kept piling up. I had to shut the business down, but my family stepped in. They believed in me, and honestly, I felt like I couldn\u2019t stop. They supported me financially, encouraged me to start again. So, I took out another loan, believing that this time would be different. But it wasn\u2019t. I launched new products, and they didn\u2019t work. I shut down again. And then, because I couldn\u2019t give up, I tried again. And again. And again.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2023, my brand generated 29 million pesos (about $512,000) in sales. I spent an estimated 8 million pesos (about $141,000) on ads alone. I was able to grow my social media presence to 227k followers on facebook and 11k on instagram. I had local celebrities and influencers reaching out to me for collaboration during those times. Yet, somehow, here I am, with nothing to show for it but overwhelming debt and a heart full of regret. I have no idea where the money went. Operational costs were through the roof. At one point, I rented a warehouse for 50,000 pesos ($880) a month. I hired more employees and raised their salaries significantly because I truly believed that the success I had in December 2020 would continue forever.\n\nIt didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve shut the business down for good now. This year, I tried affiliate marketing(US based). My first month was profitable\u2014I made 60,000 pesos ($1,060). I thought, maybe this is it. Maybe I\u2019ve finally found something that works. But again, it fell apart. I ended up adding another 250,000 pesos ($4,400) to my debt(through facebook ads). Then I wrote and launched an ebook, pouring everything into it. Ads, campaigns, promotions\u2014it added another 250,000 pesos to my debt. I really thought, maybe I went through everything for this moment. I was sharing something I believed in deeply\u2014the secret supplier, the supplier of all suppliers. Profit was, of course, the first priority, but this time it felt different. I wanted to become successful while helping others achieve their success too.\n\nBut in the end, once again, it wasn\u2019t. It failed just like the rest, and the heartbreak was unbearable. I had poured my hope, my energy, and my belief into this, thinking it was finally my moment. Instead, it became another painful reminder of how far I\u2019d fallen.\n\nEvery failure has led me deeper into depression. It\u2019s heavy. So heavy. Earlier this year I took so many courses and read books on mindset. And when I tried new things, I also did it with a new mindset. And now, I\u2019m so scared to go back to the person I was before. During all those times when I was chasing success I was miserable. Stuck on survival mode that it affected how I was as a person, mom, wife, daughter and friend. At some point I\u2019m proud of the person I am now, because if I was still who I was these past years I would seriously be contemplating ending my life. And the worst part? My parents. They\u2019ve stepped in so many times, covering loans, supporting me, believing in me. They shouldn\u2019t have to. They\u2019re at an age where they should be resting, enjoying life, not worrying about their daughter\u2019s financial mess. I feel like I\u2019ve failed them spectacularly\u2014over and over again. I was supposed to retire them early, to give back after all they\u2019ve given me. Instead, I\u2019ve only added to their stress.\n\nI keep asking myself, why do I dream so big? Why can\u2019t I just accept a normal life, a stable life? Why can\u2019t I stop chasing this idea that I\u2019m meant for more? I feel like I\u2019ve been stuck in this cycle for years\u2014dreaming, failing, trying again. And now, I\u2019m at the point where I don\u2019t even know who I am without those dreams. I\u2019m tired. I feel defeated. I don\u2019t know how to move forward, but I know I can\u2019t keep going like this.\n\nTo anyone reading this: How do you let go of your dreams and accept that, no matter how deeply you knew in your heart you were meant for greatness, you\u2019re not? I\u2019m 31 years old.\n\nEDIT: \n\nI want to thank everyone who took the time and effort to comment on my post. Your empathy, insights, and advice have been incredibly valuable, and I truly appreciate the kindness and support you\u2019ve shown.\n\nFor context, I\u2019ve taken multiple courses on Facebook ads and marketing, which helped me grow my following and achieve those sales figures. My first business was actually profitable in terms of ad cost versus revenue. However, I rushed things and made decisions that weren\u2019t realistic. Looking back, if I had taken it slow, avoided loans, and been content with making 100k-300k pesos (roughly $1,800-$5,400) a day, the business might still be alive today. Unfortunately, I wanted more\u2014so I took loans, got a warehouse, and hired more employees. When sales slowed down, the loan payments piled up, and I eventually had to shut it all down last year, in 2023.\n\nThis year, I tried affiliate marketing through ClickBank (after taking another course). It was profitable at first, but like before, it eventually wasn\u2019t sustainable. I only tried two products and one MRR (Master Resell Rights) product, and while I generated significant revenue, it still wasn\u2019t enough to turn a profit overall.\n\nLastly, despite wanting to \u201cgatekeep\u201d my supplier (their value lies in being a direct Chinese platform for factories and manufacturers\u2014most sellers on Alibaba and AliExpress are just middlemen and their supplier is this supplier), my sister encouraged me to write an ebook about it since I no longer plan to sell physical products. The goal was to help others while also helping myself.\n\nMoving forward, I\u2019ve decided to focus on freelancing or virtual assistance to gain stability and work toward reducing my debt rather than adding more to it.\n\nI also want to add how grateful I am to have heard from strangers this time. It\u2019s given me a different perspective\u2014a view I couldn\u2019t see on my own.",

      "content": "Hey Reddit,  \nI am 30 years old and educated with a Business degree. After years I landed a job in one of the leading financial groups in Asia. It is great but I felt dull. Lacking of excitements, perhaps its too easy, in some aspects so ..\n\nI made a leap that some might call crazy\u2014I left my $230k job in finance to start my own sourcing company in China. It's been a whirlwind of emotions, but oddly, it feels good.   \nIn finance, my days were predictable. I had set tasks, clear goals, and a pretty good idea of what my paycheck would look like at the end of the year. It was comfortable, but somewhere along the line, it started to feel a bit too... scripted. I craved something more, something that felt like my own.  \nTransitioning to running my own business was like stepping into a different world. Suddenly, there were no clear-cut tasks at the start of each day, no guaranteed paycheck waiting for me. The uncertainty was daunting. Every decision felt like a gamble. Would this supplier be reliable? Can I ensure the quality of the products? How do I manage logistics, warehousing, and especially the nuances of communication and customization with Chinese factories?   \nBut here's the thing\u2014despite the sleepless nights and the steep learning curve, there's a part of this journey that's incredibly fulfilling. For every challenge, there's a victory. For every setback, a lesson learned. The freedom to steer my own ship, to build something from the ground up, has brought a sense of accomplishment I never found in my previous job.  \nI've come to realize that the unpredictability is not a bug; it's a feature. It's what keeps me on my toes, pushes me to innovate, and forces me to grow. And while the path of a business owner is fraught with challenges  \nHere's to the weirdly good feeling of embracing the unknown.  \n",

I'm looking for more of a private agent than an own way to get to suppliers. A person that can hook me up with both drop for testing and private label for scaling. Where do I even start looking for one? I'm not really keen on looking for anyone on Reddit for that cuz \"my friend we're the best I provide for you cheap price fast shipping\" is not convincing to me. I know damn well a private agent will promise me a candy land, but I've had a 2 or 3 - one found on Reddit who turned out terrible despite promising whatnot. A person lurking for a client in every Reddit post doesn't seem to be reliable in the first place, but well, correct me if I'm wrong. \n2. Is there any other way than to simply start working with someone to determine credibility of that agent? \n3. Is it better to approach agents in Chinese than English? I've translated a few stores in the past few months and handled multilingual customer support, so I'm pretty used to using chat GPT for talking in other languages - and since the language barrier seems to be a problem quite often, I would be fine talking in Chinese, I think\n4. Will a good private agent won't even talk to me, if I don't have a certain MOQ? I know private agent is usually a next step, rather than getting one when the store is not even up - but when you want to sell products almost no one sells, or a variation of it that no one sells - you need to source it with ways out of reach for most people. So a product that's not available on Ali, or CJ, or wherever. I don't want to be the 12th guy selling the same neck massager, got dang it\n5. Are agencies better than private agents? I know they're more expensive, but what about performance?\n6. How did you find your agent, and how is it going? Tell me your story mate! ",

There will be an onslaught of advancements that take place that are borderline inconceivable due to the nature of exponential progress. This will change every single vertical.\n\nI'm making this post because I think AI execution strategy will make or break businesses. Dramatically. Over **$50B** was put into AI startups in 2023 alone. This figure excludes the hundreds of billions poured into AI from enterprises. So, let's follow the money:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1) AI enterprise software.**\n\nThere's a lot to unpack here and this is what I\u2019m currently working on. AI enterprise software will encompass everything from hyper personalized email outbound to AI cold calls to AI that A/B tests ads on synthetic data to vertical specific software. The impact of the former is relatively self explanatory, so I'll focus on the latter. To illustrate vertical specific AI software, I'll use a simple example in the legal space. Lawyers typically have to comb through thousands of pages of documents. Now, using an LLM + a VDB, an AI can instantly answer all of those questions while surfacing the source and highlighting the specific answer in the contract/document. There are dozens of AI startups for this use case alone. This saves lawyers an immense amount of time and allows them to move faster. Firms that adopt this have a fundamental advantage over law firms that don't adopt this. This was 2023 technology. I'm seeing vertical AI software getting built by my friends in areas from construction, to real estate, to even niche areas like chimney manufacturing. This will exist everywhere. Now, this can be extrapolated much further to be applicable to systems that can do reports and even browse the Internet. This brings me to my next point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2) AI information aggregation and spread.**\n\nMy gut tells me that this will have a crescendo moment in the future with hardware advancements (*Rabbit, Tab, etc.*). You won't have to google things because it will be surfaced to you. It's predictive in nature. The people who can get information the fastest will grow their business the fastest. This part is semi-speculative, but due to the nature of LLMs being so expensive to train, I have a strong feeling that large institutions will have access to the *\\*fastest\\** and *\\*best\\** models that can do this quicker than you and I can. This is why it's important to stay on top.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3) AI content generation**\n\nThis is relevant to running advertisements and any digital marketing aspect of your business. If you can rapidly make content faster than your competitors to put in social media, you will outpace your competitors rapidly. I think most folks are familiar with MidJourney, Stable diffusion, etc. but don't know how to use it. You can generate consistent models for a clothing brand or generate images of a product that you would normally need to hire a professional photographer to take. There's also elevenlabs which is relatively easy to use and can be used to make an MP3 clip as a narration for an ad; this is something I've already done. I'm also still shocked by how many people are unfamiliar with tools like [**Pika**](https://pika.art) which can do video generation. You could imagine companies having ***fleets of digital influencers*** that they control or conjuring up the perfect ad for a specific demographic using a combination of all of the aforementioned tools.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In summary,** if you feel like I'm being hyperbolic or propagating science fiction fantasies, you're likely already behind. I truly recommend that everyone stays up to date on these advancements as much as possible. If your competitor comes across an AI tool that can increase their ROAS by 5x they can crush you. If your competitor uses a tool that increases the rate at which they receive and aggregate information by 200% (modest estimate) they will crush you. If your competitors have a tool that can reduce their employee size, then they will use it. They'll fire their employees to cut costs and reinvest the money back into their business. It will compound to the point where you're outpaced, and this isn't a level of innovation we've seen since the birth of the industrial revolution. Your customers can get stolen overnight, or you can steal your competition\u2019s customers overnight.\n\n**TL;DR:** This is an opportunity for entrepreneurs to scale faster than they could have possibly imagined, but this also comes with the potential for your company to be obliterated. We've never seen advancements that can have this drastic of an impact this quickly. Adoption will happen fast, and first movers will have a disproportionate and compounding advantage. Watch guides, meet with startups, follow the news, and get rich.",

(not all products of course but many)\n\nFor example, in my mind I was going to purchase a product wholesale from a company I know and love and is in the USA thinking their products are made in the USA too... But then I learn they're just buying their products from china on Alibaba just like everyone else! Why the hell did I think sustainable and \"made in USA\" were synonymous? \n\nI guess now I just feel bad. for 1 because I'm now learning this is the world we live in when it comes to retail but also 2 because where does that leave me? Why wouldn't I skip the middle man (wholesaler) when I can just go straight to the source (china/Alibaba/whatever) for a fraction of the cost? But seeing as I'm a \"sustainable\" retailer I guess now I feel like a fraud.\n\nI'm new to this world... so if you have advice on how to source products and suppliers that focuses on sustainability and ethical practices I would love to hear it. \n\nNote: it's okay commentators you can rip me a new one. also note\\* obviously I'm not sourcing everything from china.

      "title": "How I've been making over 10k / mon. since 20 (25 now)",
      "content": "Want to give some value, in particular for the younger guys, as I know how the online entrepreneur space is these days. SMMA, dropshipping, crypto, lambos, Miami, Dubai, I know what it's like to see that stuff all over the internet. All of these gurus, infoproduct guys, etc. etc. \n\nMy average month is about 20k-30k now, I do real life business, I didn't just hit it once, It has been consistent. I had a clothing brand agency, well still do, and my biggest month was about 25k Rev, but the majority of money I've made was in sales. I've tried dropshipping, SMMA, Crypto, all of it. My first sales job was as a door to door canvasser, setting free roof inspections for a roofing company at 19. I didn't want to do it, I had too much pride, always told myself I'd run my own company, be a millionaire before everyone else. I was the only kid my age at the time into self improvement, going to seminars, Tony Robbins, Gary Vee, etc. but I didn't have the vehicle to make my first money yet. I eventually lost my job, car got totaled, I was late on rent, no source of transportation and this offer came up. Long story short, I did it and made my rent that first week, which was $1,000 at the time (2018). The sales guys that were closing all made over $100k. Before you make a million, you need to surpass six figures. \n\nNow I'll get deeper into the specific industry I'm in but I want to highlight D2D, and sales in general as it relates to entrepreneurs. The entrepreneurial spirit is something some of us are born and gifted with. It is only a matter of time before you find the vehicle to express that. Entrepreneurship is a sport to a degree, but it's a mental one, not physical. There are skillsets involved, like in sports. A fighter will train to enhance his skills, speed, power, cardio, different fighting styles, boxing, BJJ, etc. I say this because as an entrepreneur, your ability to succeed depends on your strengths and weaknesses, and building your strengths is only a matter of putting in reps. No course or PDF will put reps in for you. You need to train and persistently put in those reps to enhance those skills that translate into desired outcomes and results. This is where sales comes in. D2D is unlimited entrepreneurship training, and the best part is you get paid to learn. If you started a business from scratch right now, with no experience, you'd need to sell one of two things, a product, or a service. Now in the creation of that product or service, there are skillsets involved in doing so, you have to build those, and if you want to succeed at them, you have to get good as well. In sales, its one primary skill, you're selling someone else's product or service, so you don't have to worry about the fulfillment or management of that business. Sales and marketing drive revenue simply speaking. If you can sell and market, you can profit. Where many young people, myself included, go wrong, is they hear about these business models that these guys teach, and try to manage a business that they know nothing about. They tell you how they made $10k, $100k per month. And give you a blue print of what they're doing, but you didn't put in the reps they did. If LeBron put out a course on how to shoot better, I imagine there's some value in that, but you aren't putting in LeBrons work, and with his natural gifts, so you're not going to become him. Lock in on whats in front of you and progress by mastering one thing, then learning the next skillset you know you'll need to learn on the trajectory to become a master CEO. This is the way, not chasing online trends. FB ads changes, Tik Tik changes, Instagram changes, markets get saturated. Build you. \n\nNow what is the industry I'm in? Exterior home restoration. What is that? Well basically we complete work on homes from storm damage, hail, winds, tornadoes, hurricanes, etc. and insurance pays for the work. Every home owner has insurance, and these companies pay for repairs to be completed. Like an auto body shop, if you crash a car, or got hail damage, the company pays the shop, shop does the work, and boom everyone's happy. I started setting leads, went on to closing deals, then later started project managing. Roofing was the bread and butter, but I've made the most of money so far doing niche high end windows that get damaged by hail. These windows are 5x the cost of a roof, and most contractors have no clue how to deal with the claims and install. I have an LLC and subcontracted by the contractors to generate deals. I close the deals, they complete the work. This is my business, and it works well. I get a $5k avg. per deal, and I sell a lot. If you're interested in learning more about this specific industry fire away questions or DM me, I'm more than happy to help. ",

      "title": "What I learnt from sourcing e-commerce products from China.",
      "content": "DISCLAIMER: The intention of this to increase cautiousness and practice best practices between the entrepreneurs that are importing from China. \n\nSo I have been running an e-commerce store for a very long time, not a drop-shipping particularly but we would order the products in bulk to the country and then ship from there (For faster shipping).I wanted to do drop-shipping but then it halted back in 2019, right after the COVID and ePacket was banned >!(ePacket is a shipping agreement between US and China to reduce shipping times, it uses passenger planes to carry the parcel, hence faster shipping)!<.\n\nAnyway getting back to the point, We were selling jewellery in the United States, firstly we used to just order from Aliexpress (a bunch of 500 every week) to our warehouse, do the quality check and then we would ship it from there. However the price per item was $7.80 and it was selling for $25.99 with a good profit margin.\n\nWe decided to scale that store (I shared the scaling strategy in a different blog post) by going to a supplier and ordering 10K since Q4 was coming up and we were trying to scale up, the item was selling like a hot dog. We posted a few Request For Quotation on Alibaba and got some quotations and here are my learnings.\n\n* **You will get the same product for less.**\n\nThe item we were getting for $7.80 was available for as low as $4.00 if we ordered in bulk, and as high as $10, so it varies. If you order $10K units then it will be available for $2.00. The more volume you ask for the lesser the cost will be - I mean it's normal, but the cost can go very low. I mean compare $7.80 to $2.00\n\n* **You will have to do your own quality check.**\n\nAlibaba is not like Amazon where they do the quality check for you, you will have to do your quality check before you ship the items to your customers. We ordered 10K and got around 300 defective items from the supply. (either they were broken, or of a bad quality). And then you have to send them to the supplier, the supplier will usually ask you to send the items back but it's not worth the time. So make sure that you order at least 10% more of what you need.\n\n* **Plan your shipments accordingly and choose the correct method**\n\nUnrelated to the store, we saw a great kitchen product that we thought could do really good in the American market, but the problem? It was 1.2Kgs. It was a really large item made out of stainless steel. We wanted it faster but AIR CARGO was expensive (it was charging $2000) as we did not have time since Q4 was already around the corner, however the affordable option was ship containers but the transit time was 1 month. So make sure if you plan to order large items, do it beforehand and make sure you choose the right shipping service to save costs.\n\n* **Trust your negotiation skills.**\n\nYou got to trust your negotiations skills and don't be shy when negotiating with your suppliers, we got down the per product cost from $6 to $4.80. While it may not seem a lot but it saved around $3500 per order. So negotiation works! I mean just like any other business.\n\n* **Never ditch a supplier too early.**\n\nIf you find a better price somewhere then don't move your orders at once, we got a supplier that was giving the exact same product for almost 20% less, and ordered 500 units from them. Most of the units were defective, so always maintain multiple suppliers until you do the quality check of both of the suppliers.\n\n* **Have multiple modes of communication**\n\nIf you're using Alibaba chat to communicate with your suppliers then make sure you have their emails and WhatsApp, WeChat or anything they use because they will go offline without prior notice.\n\n* **You will get free FedEX/UPS shipping**\n\nDon't hesitate to ask for premium shipping if you maintain a good relationship, the supplier we had used to send the items using ePacket which used to take 10-14 days, talked to the supplier and he offered a premium FedEX shipping for large orders which delivered the order in 4-5 days max (to California)\n\n* **Always use AliBaba Payment Gateway**\n\nNever use PayPal, or WeChat or anything else to send the funds, it's just not worth the hassle. Even though you have the escrow services at place. I would just avoid PayPal or anything and just go with Alibaba's gateway. It is seamless and has a great grievance redressal system.\n\n* **Product Sourcing Agents are great but be careful**\n\nThere are a lot of product sourcing agents are great, they will get in touch directly with the manufacturer for you and can get any type of customisation done for you and can get you better prices. But be careful and use a better sourcing agent.\n\nI guess that was it. I will edit this post if I find more points to address.",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m currently a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University. Lately, I\u2019ve become really curious about international trade, especially how small businesses in the US manage to import products from China.\n\n\n\nA bit of context: many of my friends from high school and college (some still in China) are running \u201cinternational trade\u201d businesses. To be honest, it\u2019s quite surprising to me, because most of them don\u2019t speak much English or have any background in manufacturing or supply chains. From what I\u2019ve gathered, they mostly find local Chinese products and resell them via platforms like Alibaba and Amazon.\n\n\n\nThis got me thinking\u2014how do small businesses based in the US (who are far from the source) handle product quality, customs, and communication with suppliers? Big companies have teams, lawyers, and huge purchase volumes to leverage, but small businesses seem to face more uncertainty and risk in cross-border trade.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re a small business owner or have experience sourcing from China, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. How do you make it work? Do you use sourcing agents? How do you manage quality control remotely? Any insights or stories would be greatly appreciated.",

Based on your advice, I started looking into OEM options and 3PL services for repackaging. Some suppliers are open to private label, but the MOQ is still a bit high for testing.\n\nIf you're selling <$10 products:\n- How do you balance packaging cost with perceived value?\n- Have you found any budget-friendly packaging strategies that still look professional?\n- Do you repack in-house or use a 3PL?\n\nThanks again \u2014 this sub has been incredibly helpful.

However, I've heard that when dealing with Chinese suppliers, there's a risk that they may copy and sell your idea to others quickly. In my case, we've signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), clearly stating that my product should not be disclosed to anyone. I am currently in the process of applying for a patent in Canada, the US, and China.\n\nNow, here's the dilemma: my supplier has suggested applying for the patent on my behalf, but he's requesting my passport number. I'm feeling skeptical about this. What do you think? Should I provide him with my passport ID so he can proceed with the patent application, or is it too risky? I would appreciate hearing your thoughts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you.",

      "title": "I closed 200+ freelance deals with this script",
      "content": "I always thought I sucked at sales.\n\nGot my first job as a telemarketer when I was 16, and I quit 6 hours into my first shift.\n\nIt was emotionally exhausting and I honestly felt disgusted.\n\nThis experience scarred me for years and held me back when I started building my freelancing business 8 years later.\n\nThen I joined an absurdly expensive mastermind ($7500 / 3 months) where they shared the initial version of the script I'm about to share with you.\n\nAnd it flipped my entire mindset about what it takes to sell on its head.\n\nInstead of being salesy, they told me to act like a doctor. Diagnose and then confidently present the cure.\n\nAfter I started doing this, I closed 200+ deals for my freelancing business. From big tech companies all the way down to small mom-and-pop online stores.\n\nHere's the script that changed everything for me:\n\n# The mindset\n\nBefore we get into the \"what to say,\" we need to fix the \"how to think.\" This is 90% of the battle.\n\n* Your job isn't to push a product; it's to diagnose a problem. You should be listening, asking intelligent questions, and determining **if you're even the right person to help them**. If a doctor listened to your symptoms for 30 seconds and immediately tried to sell you on a specific surgery, you'd run. Don't be that person.\n* In the first half of the call, the client should be doing 80% of the talking. If you're talking more than them, you're pitching, not discovering. You're losing.\n* You don't\u00a0need\u00a0this client. You are evaluating\u00a0them\u00a0just as much as they are evaluating you. Think of it like a first date. You're not trying to force a second date from the moment you sit down. You're genuinely trying to see if there's a connection and if you're compatible for a long-term relationship.\n* Do not read this word-for-word. Reading makes you sound like a robot and breaks all trust.\n\n# Preparation\n\nGood prep is going to be the source of your confidence. Knowing your questions and your offer ahead of time frees up your mental energy to actively listen.\n\n1. Go through the steps below and write down 3-5 specific questions for each section.\n2. **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Prepare 1-3 clear service packages with prices**. Even if you won\u2019t be able to pitch a productized service, this will help you quickly and without hesitation answer ANY questions regarding your pricing (e.g. \"I've done similar projects for around $4.000). This makes you look like someone who\u2019s been doing this for years, is a professional and even **allows you to close the deal on the call** instead of letting the momentum die with a \"let me get back to you with a proposal.\"\n\n**The biggest mistake most people make is to NOT talk about pricing.**\n\nTalking about pricing massively speeds up the sales process, because prospects can either accept your offer immediately, decline it, or try a delay tactic.\n\nIf they accept - then great!\n\nIf they decline or delay, you can ASK them why, and you\u2019ll find out a lot about the objections they have about working with you.\n\n# The warm-up\n\nSpending 2-3 minutes on small talk shows you\u2019re a relaxed, normal person, which helps the prospect relax, too.\n\n* What to Say:\n   * \u201cI see you're based in Austin. I've heard great things about the food scene there.\u201d\n   * \u201cI have to mention this, you picked the best Zoom background.\u201d\n   * \u201cGlad we could connect before the weekend. Any exciting plans?\u201d\n\nThen, transition and set the frame. This is crucial for taking control.\n\n* \"Awesome! Well, I\u2019m excited to chat. Should we dive right in?\"\u00a0(Wait for \"yes\")\n* \"Great. So the way I usually run these calls is I'll start by asking a few questions to get a really clear picture of your business and what you're looking for. If it sounds like I can definitely help, I\u2019ll explain how I work. Sound good?\"\n\n# Discovery\n\nThis is your \"doctor\" phase. Start broad and then go deep.\n\n* **If they reached out to you:**\u00a0\"So, to start, I\u2019d love to hear what prompted you to book this call today? What\u2019s going on in your business?\"\n* **If you reached out to them:**\u00a0\"When I reached out, something in my message must have clicked. What was it that made you decide to take this call?\"\n\nNow, shut up and listen. Take notes. After their initial answer, dig deeper with your prepared, service-specific questions.\n\n* **Pro-Tip:**\u00a0If they give short, unhelpful answers, use this:\u00a0**\"Could you tell me a bit more about that?\"**\n\n# Their experience\n\nAre you talking to a seasoned pro or a total beginner? The answer dictates how you'll pitch later on and what kind of questions to ask.\n\n* \"Have you tackled this issue before? What worked or didn\u2019t work?\"\n* \"Have you worked with another freelancer or agency on this? What was that like?\"\n\nThis tells you what they value, what they hate, and what landmines to avoid. If they say their last designer was a \"terrible communicator,\" you know to highlight your communication process in your pitch.\n\nOn the other hand if they tell you they've had 20 freelancers on this and that they all sucked, you should probably run away.\n\n# Defining success\n\nThis is where you move from their\u00a0problems\u00a0to their\u00a0aspirations.\n\n* \"Okay, let's fast forward 6 months. If we were to work together on this, what would need to have happened for you to feel like this was a huge success?\"\n* \"What would achieving \\[their goal\\] actually do for your business? Why is this a priority right now?\"\n\nWhen they answer this, they are literally selling\u00a0themselves\u00a0on the value of your service. Write down their exact words.\n\n# Uncovering roadblocks\n\nWhy their problem still exists. This is the bridge to your pitch.\n\n* \"So you\u2019re looking to achieve \\[their goal\\]. What\u2019s held you back from getting this done on your own so far?\"\n* \"Why do you think you haven't found the right person to help with this yet?\"\n\nTheir answer here is pure gold. It gives you the exact angle for your pitch.\n\n* If they say \"I don't have the time,\" your solution is about a hands-off, \"done-for-you\" process.\n* If they say \"I don't have the expertise,\" your solution is about your deep knowledge and strategic guidance.\n\n# The pitch\n\nSee how late this comes? You should only pitch after you fully understand their situation.\n\n* **Ask for permission:** \"Okay, based on everything you've told me, I have a very clear picture of the situation. I'm confident I can help you achieve \\[Their Goal\\]. Would it be okay if I walk you through how I'd approach it?\"\n* **Frame it:**\u00a0\"Great. So I specialize in helping \\[businesses like them\\] to \\[achieve the exact goal they just told you\\].\"\n* **Show proof:**\u00a0\"For example, last quarter I worked with \\[Similar Client\\], who was struggling with \\[Similar Problem\\]. We implemented this process and they were able to \\[Achieve Result\\].\"\n* **Explain the process:**\u00a0Walk them through the steps.\n   * \"First, we\u2019d start with a kickoff session to...\"\n   * \"Next, I\u2019ll prepare xyz to...\"\n   * \"Finally, you\u2019ll get...\"\n\n**IMPORTANT:** DO NOT REVEAL YOUR PRICING OR PACKAGES AT THIS POINT! Focus solely on the workflow and deliverables.\n\nAfter you're done, ask them:\n\n*  \"That\u2019s the general overview. What questions do you have about that for me?\"\n\nWhen they run out of process questions, they will almost always ask the big one: \"So... how much does it cost?\" This is the moment you've been waiting for.\n\n* \"The cost for the package I just described is $7,500.\"\n\nState your price clearly and confidently. Then, the most important part:\n\n**BE SILENT.**\n\nDo not justify it. Do not explain it. Do not say \"but we can be flexible.\" The first person who talks, loses. Let them react. Their reaction tells you everything you need to know.\n\n# Handling objections\n\nAn objection is not a \"no.\" It's a request for more information or reassurance. Don't get defensive. You can't handle an objection if you don't know what they're thinking. So your first job is to figure out what they're trying to say.\n\n**\"That's more expensive than I was expecting\"**\n\n* \"I understand. Can I ask what you were budgeting for a project like this?\"\u00a0OR\u00a0\"Could you tell me a bit more about what makes it feel expensive?\"\u00a0(This helps you understand if it's a value problem or a cash flow problem).\n\n**\"I need to think about it.\"**\n\n* \"That\u2019s perfectly fine; most of my best clients take time to think. Just so I can understand, what specific part of it do you need to think about most?\"\n\n**\"Why would I pay this much when I can get someone on Fiverr for $500?\"**\n\n* \"That's a fair question. You're right, there are definitely cheaper options out there, and for simple tasks, they can be great. The question is, are you looking to buy a task, or are you looking to buy a business outcome? A task-doer will do exactly what you say. I see my role as a strategic partner to help you achieve \\[their goal\\]. Which of those is more important to you right now?\"\n\n(I've got more objections and how to handle them in the google docs I'm linking below)\n\n# The close\n\nIf they agree with your price and want to move forward, you're not done yet. You need to handle the final step professionally.\n\n* Immediately explain the next steps.\u00a0\"Great! Here\u2019s what will happen next. I'm going to send over the contract and an invoice for the initial deposit. Once that's handled, I'll send you a link to book our kickoff call.\"\n* Don't just hang up after that! Spend 2-3 minutes returning to small talk. This calms their nerves, eases potential buyer's remorse, and reinforces that you're a human they're building a relationship with, not just a vendor who got their money.\n\n# Extra info\n\nI've put some extra objection handling examples, more info, more examples, etc. into a Google Doc which I'm linking in a comment below, to keep this post on point.  \n  \nThis all takes practice to master so I also created a ChatGPT Monster prompt that will roleplay different levels of clients (easy to hard). I'm also including it at the bottom of the doc.  \n",

I'm a graduate of the four-hour workweek school of thought and my goal is to outsource everything I can, and automate everything that allows me to multiply my efforts.  \n\nHere is the full list of apps and SaaS that I use to run Woodies:\n\n[***Shopify***](http://shopify.com):  The alpha dog in the ecommerce space\n\n***Shopify Apps***:\n\n***[Login with Amazon](https://apps.shopify.com/login-with-amazon)***:  60% of traffic comes from mobile but only 20% of checkouts, why?  Because it's hard to enter your info, this allows people to login with their Amazon account, choose their address, choose their payment method and boom they're checked out.  Great app\n\n***[Make an Offer](https://apps.shopify.com/make-an-offer)***:  Exit-intent pop-up that allows customers to submit an offer for a product they wanted, they give their email, I use Zapier to shoot them a discount code and to add their email to Mailchimp\n\n***[ShopiMap](https://apps.shopify.com/shopimap)***:  It puts a pin on every customer and shows what they ordered.  Great for social proof.  [Here's mine for Woodies](https://woodies.com/pages/who-wears-woodies)\n\n***[CovetPics](https://apps.shopify.com/covet-pics)***:  Cool Instagram plug-in that makes a collage from my Instagram account and integrates the photos on each product page\n\n[***Yotpo***](http://yotpo.com):  I was lucky to get them while they cost $30/month  now it costs like $300 a month to collect reviews.  It's a really great app though, it auto-sends review requests and displays them on product pages.  I wish they picked a better name, Yotpo is kinda lame\n\n***[Spently](https://apps.shopify.com/spently)***:  I use them for sending out sweet order confirmation emails.

Luckily, I pay my mom a monthly rate to perform this valuable service.  ([*thanks mom!*](https://woodies.com/pages/contact))  Unfortunately, you can't use her!  You CAN use someone else's mom however, the website [HireMyMom](https://www.hiremymom.com/) (queue all the reddit jokes)  We all know mom's are awesome, they're usually consistent, reliable, and friendly.  For VA's, mom's are #1\n\n[***AmazonFBA***](https://services.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon/benefits.htm):  The service that receives, stores, packs, and ships 100% of my products.  Without this service, I wouldn't be able to travel full-time, I'd need to rent a warehouse, hire workers, and the rest\n\n***[Amazon Affiliates](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/welcome)***:  I sell on Shopify and Amazon, but I understand there are people out there who just LOVE Amazon Prime, so they go to my site, find a product they like, then want to buy it Amazon, I don't blame them, I would prefer free shipping also.  SO on each of my product pages, I include a link to my product listing on Amazon, I use an affiliate link so that I make like 1% of the order.  It adds up to only like $100/month, but it's better than nothing.  ***See an example: [Woodies Zebrawood Sunglasses](https://woodies.com/collections/bamboo-wood-sunglasses/products/zebra-wood-aviator-wrap-sunglasses)*** *warning: affiliate link on next page*\n\nAmazon Apps:\n\n[***FeedbackGenius***](https://www.feedbackgenius.com/):  Sends automatic feedback requests to hundreds of orders per day, reviews are so valuable on Amazon that this app pays for itself many times over\n\n***[HelloProfit](http://helloprofit.com)***:  I started realizing how many different services I use and I went in a cancelled this one, $79 a month just to make the reports section of Amazon look better, not worth it\n\nWebsite:  \n\n[***Cloudflare***](https://www.cloudflare.com):  Supposedly makes my website faster, I have no idea honestly how this works, might be wasting $20/month, can anyone chime in here??  \n\n***[Typeform](http://typeform.com)***:  Awesome way to use forms.  I use them to collect information from giveaways.  \n\n***[Zapier](http://zapier.com)***:  Works well with Typeform to transfer data in between services like Gmail - Typeform - GoogleDocs - Mailchimp - Shopify.  Example, customer buys thing, Shopify tells Gmail, Gmail sends Email with Typeform, Shopify tells Mailchimp, Mailchimp adds to segment, Customer fills out Typeform, Typeform tells Mailchimp to send out Gmail, wait what?  It gets complicated\n\n***[GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com)***:  Probably not the best out there, but whatever it works fine, never had a problem\n\nTask Management:\n\n***[Gmail](http://gmail.com)***: I try to only check it twice a day, and my absolute goal is [Inbox Zero](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/inbox-zero)\n\n*Pro-tip*  [Learn all the Gmail keyboard shortcuts](https://www.shortcutworld.com/en/mac/Gmail.html)  \n\n*Pro-tip 2*  Enable Send+Archive in Gmail Settings and set it up to automatically open your next email\n\n[***Inbox Pause***](http://inboxpause.com/):  Helps me stick to my twice a day 'batching' of emails.

Just message suppliers asking them to email you back.  1. This avoids Alibaba's terribly designed messaging system  2.

      "title": "Alibaba Hacks: The most efficient way to find suppliers on the biggest sourcing website",
      "content": "After releasing the [Import Bible (64 pages free ebook on sourcing)](http://importdojo.com) some people wanted to know my workflow how I use Alibaba to cut down the time to find quality suppliers.\n\nI made a [20 minute screencast](http://importdojo.com/alibaba-hacks/) you can watch over here or for the basic outline of what I do, simply read below.\n\nFor the general sourcing workflow have a look at my previous [case study I posted on /r/entrepreneur few weeks ago here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/34x4l5/case_study_importing_a_power_bank_from_china_all/)\n\n**Today you want to source for an action camera, similar to the GoPro cameras.**\n\nYou can start by going to the main page of Alibaba.com and input **\u201caction camera\u201d** in the search option.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/TAfSglm\n\nOk, so you found 106,946 products. At this point you want to filter your results for the most relevant suppliers. You will definitely want the suppliers to be:\n\n**Gold suppliers:**\n\nThis is a paid membership from Alibaba for the supplier. They get featured and can put up a lot more items in their catalogue (among other functions).\n\n**Onsite Checked:**\n\nThe onsite operation of the factory has been checked by Alibaba and a third party confirmed its legal existence.\n\n**Assessed suppliers:**\n\nThis is a third-party assessment usually done through a testing company to verify various parts of the company. This includes machinery, staff, engineers, workers, certification, and much more.\n\nAfter you have filtered for this you are down to 8,258 products:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/tv8C48r\n\n**Insider tip:**\n\nNow you filter down to the relevant manufacturing province. Why? Because each province in China is specific for different product categories.\n\nIf you find a few suppliers (compared to hundreds in other provinces) on Alibaba in a certain region it is almost 100% certain they are a trading company. They either buy this certain product from somewhere else to round up their product catalogue (95% in all cases) or they are really manufacturing it.\n\nBut even if they are manufacturing it in their region they are likely less attractive in terms of prices, less experienced in manufacturing this product and their raw material suppliers are also somewhere far away. Ultimately making them less competitive.\n\nThere are several reasons why you will find suppliers for a specific product settled within a province.\n\n* The infrastructure for this product is good. Meaning there are a lot of suppliers in the area supplying components for the suppliers end-product\n* The workers in this area are skilled in producing this specific product. Making it easier to manufacture the end-product. Most likely, this also improves the overall quality.\n* The province has favourable tax rates for the factory on certain products.\nNow lets look at this again. Even though you didn\u2019t know the province and where the product is mainly manufactured you can get some insights on this very easily:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Nz546Eg\n\nGuangdong province has a total of 7,766 suppliers for this product. The other provinces have only a few. So you filter by this province.\n\nNow, you are looking to buy small quantities, lets say 10 pieces to start. You can filter the supplier by MOQ now:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Ctt6PcF\n\nNow lets look at the specific suppliers. You scroll down and by hovering over the Gold supplier symbol you will see quick facts. You are basically looking for a factory that has experience in your market. This specific supplier has experience in North America, Western & Eastern Europe.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/4hP6OFi\n\n**Insider tip:**\n\nYou will want a supplier who has experience in these markets because he is probably aware of specific country requirements & regulations.\nThis helps because he may already have applied for certificates for this product that you need when importing.\n\nNow look at the product page. What does the page tell you?\n\nhttp://imgur.com/hNs5zmX\n\nYou will find the following:\n\n* Supplier has 5 year \u201cGOLD\u201d membership, which is a good sign. If he had scammed someone before Alibaba would have deleted his account and not renewed it for 5 years.\n* Price is within a reasonable range\n* Your desired MOQ can be met (10 pieces)\n* Payment terms are acceptable. I would go for PayPal at this amount.\n* The company is rather young but that doesn\u2019t matter. These type of camera\u2019s got really popular around 2012 so a company that has been in that field prior to that has actually a lot of experience.\n\n**Insider tip: The trick here is to think outside the box.**\n\nDon\u2019t only look at a supplier and try to find some issue or problem. Think about the product too. Ask yourself questions such as \u201cdoes his product portfolio make sense\u201d? Is it in line with his other products? Or as for example the last point above, \u201cwhen did these things get popular\u201d?.\n\nNow when you scroll down there are several more good indicators. For example good product photos. **You will want a supplier that can send you high-resolution photos for your packaging or private label.**\n\nhttp://imgur.com/WmRb1Um\n\nYou will see available certifications. In this case what matters are **RoHS**, **CE** & **FCC**.\n\n**RoHs** certification is necessary for most European countries & the Americas. It prohibits certain hazardous material within the product.\n**CE** is a certification for Europe to meet general standards. Its good if a supplier has this\n**FCC** is a required certification on electrical products & also a standard for the US.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/nxdQZLx\n\nYou could already feel comfortable with this supplier, but you should check further on him in person by email.\n\nNext, click on the \u201ccontact details\u201d where you will find several things that help you to evaluate the supplier further.\n\nLook at the company profile and what you can find there.\n\nAlso look at the website outside Alibaba. If you cannot find his website outside Alibaba then google his company name and try to find it that way.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/20bfi7z\n\nWhen you look at the website, pay attention on what products they manufacture. If the seller advertises cameras on Alibaba and his main products outside Alibaba are pillows then you will know they are only trading the cameras and you should look for a new supplier at this stage.\n\nBut, this supplier has mainly cameras in their assortment. Looks good so far.\n\nWhat you notice is that their address is different than the one on Alibaba. At this stage it is probably their Hong Kong office that they use to invoice their customers. Many factories in China have a company in Hong Kong for tax and banking reasons. No need to be worried at this stage.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/CR0IOH1\n\nGoing back to Alibaba, you will want to contact the supplier with your request now. You need to sign in to Alibaba to send a message.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/l9Q1Y1f\n\nBasically you want to ask for a price, MOQ, delivery time and to which customers he is selling this item too. Obviously you also need to do routine checks on factory standards, product certifications and supplier profiles. If you would order from this factory later you should also look into having an inspection by a third-party.\n\nHere is what the inquiry could look like:\n\n*Hi\u2026,*\n\n*My name is \u2026.. and I am the \u2026.(Manager/President/Buyer etc.) of \u2026. Limited/Inc.*\n\n*We are a (fill in your company\u2019s business, e.g., Importer/Buying Office/Whole seller/Online shop) and are operating in (fill in your country).*\n*You can also check out our website: www. \u2026..*\n\n*I am writing you today to inquire about a product I saw on your website/catalogue/exhibition.*\n\n*Here is a link to the product I am looking for:*\n\n*http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Wifi-Sport-Camera-Wifi-Action-Camera_1880459810.html*\n\n*Could you please give me the following information:*\n\n*Unit price based on 10 Pieces*\n*Minimum Order Quantity*\n*Available certification (CE, RoHS, FCC, GS, etc.)*\n*Production lead time*\n*Available colors*\n*Payment terms*\n*You can fill in the details in the attached quotation format or send me your quotation in the first step. Then I will evaluate your offer and get back to* *you as soon as possible.*\n\n*If you have any questions please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me.*\n\n*Thanks and best regards,*\n\nYou should now repeat this step and send an inquiry to at least 3 more companies on Alibaba.\n\nIf he didn\u2019t follow up on all your questions make sure to email him back and ask again.\n\nFor example if you need to know about certifications and they didn\u2019t reply to that, ask them.\n\n**Insider tip:**\n\nSometimes suppliers put all available certifications on Alibaba but they don\u2019t tell you that they charge extra for them. A RoHS, CE or FCC certification can cost from 200USD up.\n\nAsk to see copies of certificates.\n\n* Do the certificates match up with the article number that the supplier gave you? \u2014 > If not, ask about it\n* Is the certificate expired? \u2014 > If yes, ask if he would renew once order is placed.\n* Who issued the certificate? \u2014 > If it is a local Chinese company google them and see what you can find about their service.\n* If they don\u2019t have certificates yet, ask them if they could apply for them once you place an order.\n\nMake sure you tell them that you will not release any payments if the certificates are not available upon shipment. If you book an inspection company, make sure to instruct your inspection company to check on this.\n\nOnce you received the suppliers feedback it is time to follow up with him on samples.\n\nFor more details on how to order & test your samples properly check my other articles:\n[Here](http://importdojo.com/sample-communication-with-your-suppliers-an-in-depth-guide/)\n&\n[Here](http://importdojo.com/testing-your-samples/)\n\nOther tips for Alibaba:\n\n**AliSource Pro**\nThere is a rather new service called AliSource Pro. You can basically send quotation requests to thousands of suppliers.\n\nHere is what it looks like:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/9sgvuHo\n\nYou can input all product details and submit. Within a few hours you should have a couple of offers.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Xu1STHk\n\nThe downside to this is that there is not much filtering. Random suppliers will send you offers and some of them don\u2019t even match your inquiry. I suggest filling in as many details as possible and then going trough the whole process of filtering & scanning a supplier as described above.\n\n**Google the supplier**\n\nIf you cannot find much about the supplier on Alibaba, Google the suppliers name and see what you can find. Perhaps even try \u201csupplier name forums\u201d.\nThat way you maybe find something (positive or negative) in forums about the supplier.\n\nThese are the basics of sourcing on Alibaba, of course there is more to that. [I provide plenty of information for free on my blog](http://importdojo.com) that will get you started. There is no need to delay getting into this business, with all the tools available these days everyone can start importing from overseas and building their own brand.\n\n",

They have it good.\u201d\n\nYet every single behemoth in existence once had to court its first customer.\n\n[In this post](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/how-to-get-first-customers/), I feature some of their stories. You\u2019ll find in them a generous mix of grunt work, guts, and genius.\n\n**1 & 2: Tinder and Alibaba \u2013 physically traveled to their first users**\n\n*Tinder went from 5,000 to 15,000 users by getting sorority girls to signup on the spot*\n\nCrucial to [Tinder\u2019s success](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/how-tinder-obtained-more-than-50-million-users-through-word-of-mouth/) was then-CMO Whitney Wolfe\u2019s ideas for building an early user-base. She planned a tour that would take her to prominent college campuses around the country.\n\n- She would go to chapters of her sorority, do her presentation, and have all the girls at the meetings install the app.\n- Then she\u2019d go to the corresponding brother fraternity\u2014they\u2019d open the app and see all these cute girls they knew.\n- Tinder had fewer than 5,000 users before Wolfe made her trip. When she returned, there were some 15,000.\u201d\n\n*Alibaba \u201cbrute-forced\u201d its success by visiting factories one by one*\n\nBack in the early \u201900s,  Jack Ma sent out a large sales force to fan out across the country, visiting factories one by one to show them how they could use Alibaba and Taobao to sell stuff online.\n\nBack then, a large number of factories in China weren\u2019t used to working with other people online, and sometimes didn\u2019t even have computers or Internet.\n\nIt was hard work, but companies quickly flocked to Alibaba and its holdings. This allowed them to get an edge over eBay.\n\n**3 & 4: Quora and Reddit \u2013 seeded their sites with their own content**\n\n*Founders solved the chicken-and-egg problem by contributing the bulk of early content themselves*\n\n[Quora](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/quora-marketing-strategy/) and Reddit are two of the largest online forums in existence today, but they were once ghost towns with the chicken-and-egg problem of \u201cempty site = no users / no users = empty site\u201d.\n\nQuora co-founders D\u2019Angelo, Cheever and Cox wrote most of the earliest questions and answers themselves. The first employees and beta testers then continued this trend, until the platform generated enough activity for them to stop.\n\nReddit did the same, but it also created fake profiles. According co-founder Steve Huffman, it took several months before the front page would fill up organically without their submissions.\n\n**5 & 6: Threadless and Dropbox \u2013 the biggest believers in word-of-mouth**\n\n*Dropbox launched shared folders and a massive referral campaign*\n\nThe Dropbox empire was built on referrals.\n\n- With its massive word of mouth campaign, Dropbox grew its user base by 40 times \u2013 from 100,000 to 4,000,000.\n- In April 2010 alone, Dropbox users sent 2.8 million direct referral invites.\n- But on top of that, Dropbox itself was designed to encourage sharing. They introduced shared folders, a nifty feature that encouraged users to invite others to share access to folders.\n\n*Threadless let its community run their own initiatives*\n\nOne of Threadless\u2019 crucial early moves was to start a massive word-of-mouth campaign.\n\nFrom the get-go, [Threadless supported community](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/threadless-marketing-strategy/) initiated \u201crogue contests\u201d(spontaneous, themed tee shirt contests).\n\nIn turn, its community is insanely creative, and also fiercely loyal brand advocates.\n\n**7: Black Milk: Fashion + Fandoms = Great Success!**\n\nThe clothing store achieved its impressive growth by milking fandom for its worth. It didn\u2019t stop at making pop culture-inspired apparel \u2013 it established serious legitimacy by getting official license for all their geeky wear.\n\nIt\u2019s also made its Facebook page a fandom watering hole. Over there, dedicated \u201cSharkies\u201d can connect with like-minded fans.\n\nThere\u2019s even a Black Milk-approved group where girls can swap, buy, and sell their purchases with each other.\n\n**8: OKCupid \u2013 legendary content on OKTrends averaged 4,222 tweets per post**\n\nThe content on OKTrends was so mindblowingly insightful that people actually despaired when it was discontinued. Who wouldn\u2019t want to read and share this post titled \u201c10 Charts About Sex\u201c? (Do it, it\u2019s worth all your attention.)\n\nFrom August 2010 to April 2011, OkTrends posts averaged a staggering 32,500 Facebook likes and 4,222 tweets.\n\nCo-founder Rudder says, \u201cHonestly I think the blog\u2013one way or another\u2013has driven a lot of our growth. Certainly, it has driven brand awareness. It\u2019s been the only thing we\u2019ve ever done, other than making a great dating site, that has gotten us out there into the world.\u201d\n\n**9: Etsy \u2013 harvested interest by reaching out to target communities before launching**\n\n[Etsy founders](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/etsy-marketing-strategy/) used to run a web design shop and were working on getcrafty.com for one of their projects, during which they discovered the need for a marketplace for handmade crafts.\n\nSo, while they built Etsy, they reached out to the craft community on getcrafty.com and Craftster.org, which had an even larger user base.\n\nBy the time they launched, they already had a lot of interest generated among the two platforms, and that helped get the required inventory and start off transactions on Etsy.\n\n**10: Buffer \u2013 got to 100k users primarily through frequent guest blogging**\n\nCo-founder Leo Wildrich wrote 150 guest posts in the first 9 months of running Buffer, and he swears by it. That\u2019s 16-17 posts per month, or more than 1 every two days!\n\n\u201cRelationships are actually the most valuable things that you gain from guest posting. At the end of the day, if you do a lot of guest posting you simply make a lot of friends. I\u2019ve got great friends over at Treehouse, Social Media Examiner, SocialMouths, and other great sites. You provide someone with free content, that\u2019s a great favor if you think about it, so it\u2019s a great opportunity to make friends with these awesome people.\u201d\n\n**11: ASOS \u2013 the ecommerce store mailed its own print magazine to 400,000 customers**\n\nBack in 2006, CEO Nick Robertson insisted that the glossy print catalog was still key to making the brand an essential part of customers\u2019 lives. Today, besides maintaining a content-rich site, ASOS also has a magazine with a circulation of 456,000 \u2013 the 18th largest in the UK, immediately behind Glamour and Closer, and just a handful of places behind New.\n\nUnconditional, free shipping was irresistable.\n\nOne of the things that kept customers flocking to ASOS was its incredible shipping and returns policy \u2013 even in its early days, ASOS was shipping for free and without minimum purchase. That policy has only just recently changed, but ASOS already has a loyal fanbase worldwide.\n\n**12 & 13: Twitter and Foursquare \u2013 exploded their userbases at SXSW with guerrilla marketing**\n\n*SXSW 2007 \u2013 Twitter lived streamed the conference on huge plasma screens*\n\nCo-founder Evan Williams decided to visualize the service on 60 inch plasma screens in the hallways, because \u201cWe knew hallways were where the action was\u201d. Twitter created an event-specific feature that allowed attendees to follow a handful of \u201cambassadors\u201d.\n\nAccording to Newsweek\u2019s Steven Levy, \u201cHundreds of conference-goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters. Panelists and speakers mentioned the service, and the bloggers in attendance touted it.\u201d During the event, Twitter usage went from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000.\n\n*Foursquare \u2013 grew average check-ins from 250k to 350k with just chalk and rubber balls*\n\nFoursquare didn\u2019t have a booth like most other brands at the 2010 SXSW convention. Neither did it have Twitter\u2019s marketing budget (Twitter spent $11k on its SXSW campaign). Instead, it set up an actual game of \u201cfour square\u201d in front of the convention hall, which involved just chalk and two rubber balls.\n\nThe game drew thousands of walk-up participants [1], Said CEO Dennis Crowley, \u201cWe played all day long, and there was always a waiting line. We were handing out tee shirts, buttons, and stickers. Anytime someone didn\u2019t know what Foursquare was, we helped them find it on their phone. We helped get them up and running and using it.\u201d\n\n**14: Taskrabbit \u2013 focused on delighting moms in Boston**\n\nTaskrabbit first cornered the market with one mothers\u2019 group in Boston\n\nTaskrabbit is similar to Uber in its hyperlocal focus. Leah Busque talked about Taskrabbit\u2019s early traction in response to a question \u201cHow did you acquire your first 10,000 users?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can be tempting to just go really broad, really wide scale, really fast. But for us, we just focused on a customer segment. We focused on this mothers\u2019 group in Boston. And once we had cornered that market with that moms\u2019 group, those moms were talking to other moms on Beacon Hill and Backbay and Cambridge and it just spread from there.\u201d\n\n**15: Airbnb \u2013 shuttled from coast to coast to talk to their first users**\n\n*Founders went the extra mile for their earliest users*\n\nFounders Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk and Joe Gebbia acted on Paul Graham\u2019s advice in their Y Combinator days and \u201cdid things that didn\u2019t scale\u201d. Specifically, they went to NYC to acquire their earliest users, then followed up with them extensively.\n\n\u201cWhen New York took off, we flew back every weekend. We went door to door with cameras taking pictures of all these apartments to put them online. I lived in their living rooms. And home by home, block by block, communities started growing. And people would visit New York and bring the idea back with them to their city.\u201d \u2013 Brian Chesky, for The Atlantic\n\n\u201cBecause of the Democratic National Conventions, some people were using the site in New York and listing places. We would reach out to the very few people we had and get to know them, figure out what products they needed and what we could offer them. We tried to build loyalty knowing that if we did that, they would tell their friends. We\u2019d host parties and meetups and all sorts of different things. \n\nThrough that process, they\u2019d get very excited and tell their friends about Airbnb. It was mostly about generating as much buzz and excitement to get them to tell their friends about us.\u201d \u2013 Chesky, Startups Open-sourced\n\n*Airbnb believed in generating word-of-mouth, which would attract the press, which would generate more word-of-mouth*\n\n\u201cWe never dressed up in gorilla suits but we passed out fliers in coffee shops, train stations\u2014we did all sorts of things. I don\u2019t know what tactics worked more than others, but I think press was always the number one tactic for us. The press would spark another group of users, then we\u2019d go visit those people and talk to them and get them excited. It was a pattern that repeated itself.\u201d \u2013 Chesky, Startups Open-sourced\n\n**16: Yelp \u2013 grew a loyal user base by rewarding quality reviews**\n\n*Gave \u201cKudos\u201d for good behavior*\n\nYelp wanted to create a tight community of consistent reviewers and high quality reviews. It rightly guessed that people were more likely to write in-depth, well crafted reviews when their names appeared alongside them. So it offered special recognition to users who were first to review a business, and let other users give kudos for reviews that are useful, funny, or cool.\n\nAnd the numbers in 2006 show that most Yelp reviewers got hooked on the site:\n\nUsers who contributed 6 or more reviews:\n\nCitySearch \u2013 4.8%\nYahoo Local \u2013 11.1%\nYelp \u2013 65.8%\nUsers who left only one review:\n\nCitySearch \u2013 71.2%\nYahoo Local \u2013 56.4%\nYelp \u2013 9.2%\n\n*Treated their best \u201cElite\u201d users generously*\n\nThe most engaged Yelp users are elevated to \u201cElite\u201d status, visible by a shiny Elite badge on their account profile. By 2006, a full 44% of reviews on the site were contributed by Yelp Elite. \n\nDave Kim, a six-year Yelp Elite user with over 900 reviews, explains:\n\n\u201cYelp does a good job of finding ways to reward people, not through monetary means, but little perks \u2026 At regular Yelp Events, Elites often got first-chance to RSVP and even got in an hour before everyone else. There are specific events just for Yelp Elite that offer free food and drinks and swag.\u201d\n\n**17: Groove \u2013 reached out to the customers that \u201cgot away\u201d**\n\nCEO Alex Turnbull has written a very detailed analysis of Groove\u2019s early customer acquisition tactics, along the theme of doing things that don\u2019t scale. The tactic that stood out the most was scrapping \u2013 reaching out to customers who chose other competitors, and sincerely asking the reasons for their choice. From the exercise, Turnbull discovered and fixed several bugs, and convince customers to give Groove another chance.\n\n\n",

      "title": "I became a self made millionaire at 25 in a third world country. I will share my story here:",
      "content": "I am from Central America, a tropical region with lots of poverty and problems.\nSince I was a kid, I had the drive to put extra effort on achieving something. I started selling bananas to construction workers at 7 later selling candy to schoolmates at 10.\n\nAt 15 I decided to study business and become either an over achiever employee or a business owner, at that time I didn\u2019t exactly know which path to take.\nWhile I was in university (BA studies), I noticed I had a lot of spare time after school, so instead of wasting my time on leisure, I decided to start a business, I had no clue of which kind of business start (also to start one that didn\u2019t require much money because I had none.) I met with fellow classmates that were smart and also wanted to stand out, so together we decided to start a coffee distribution company. \n\nWe were offering coffee to restaurants and hotels but competition was very tough and we just couldn\u2019t close deals to get to break even. I started noticing the first signs of a red ocean industry and how tough it is to stand out in that kind of industry. My cofounders were not putting the same effort as I was, and that frustrated me. At a point my dorm served as the company\u2019s warehouse, packing center and distribution center, I was closing almost all of the sales with clients and also doing the delivery. I noticed many companies offered high quality coffee but only a few offered high quality tea. Also in my region (a coffee growing region) there are a lot of coffee sellers as we live in a coffee growing country. Tea was always imported from Asia and few companies actually focused on it. I noticed there was an opportunity on focusing on tea, instead of coffee. \n\nI offered my cofounders to buy their shares and they agreed (for them it was a relief) so I started sourcing tea that was grown locally and mixing it with herbs, spiced and fruits to create tasty tea blends. The product was very good and without competitors, so I went to Mcdonald\u2019s HQ and offered the product for Mccafe. Mcdonald\u2019s loved the product and agreed on the price (they also liked that I was very young). My tea processing was being done at my dorm so I lacked all the licenses required to supply at Mcdonald\u2019s standards, so I was very sincere with the Supply Chain director and told him I had all the desire but lacked the money to build the proper tea facility. I offered him teapots and with the teapot earnings I could buy the machinery and equipment required to supply them properly and also to get the sanitary approvals. He agreed on the teapots and gave me a 50% advance ($50k) for them. I bought 5,000 teapots in Alibaba (China) for $3 each and sold them at $20 to Mccafe. I used all the profits to build the facility and it took me almost one year to finally start supplying Mcdonald\u2019s.\n\n\nWhile I was already supplying them, I noticed the tea market was very small (a Blue Ocean kind, but actually a blue pond) \nMy ambitious goals (become a billionaire at 35) would be tough to reach staying exclusively in the tea industry.\nI kept hustling for two years on the tea, until an opportunity came to me (or I came to it).\n\n\nWhile I was offering tea to a sushi restaurant, out of curiosity, asked if the fish served there was locally caught.\nThe owner said; \u201cNo, it comes from Asia because local fish has bad quality and I can\u2019t risk my restaurant\u2019s reputation or client\u2019s health giving them bad quality fish.\u201d\n\nIt startled me that local restaurants didn\u2019t use local fish even though we have plenty access to both Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. Seemed like an obvious problem, so I started to find out why, what asians did right and what us, central americans did wrong.\n\nAfter months of obsessive research, the problem was lack of knowledge and investment in the local fishing industry resulting in fisherman living in poverty conditions with no ability to supply high quality fish. The solution was to teach them good practices and invest in a high quality seafood processing facility, the cost of the solution was over $400,000 in investment money that I didn\u2019t had.\n\n\nSo I decided to build a team, test out our theory and provide the product to restaurants and learn form their feedback. It was a lean start up mentality to start small and cheap to prove the business thesis. We received excellent feedback and real purchase interest from restaurants.\nThat was enough to know it was a great opportunity and also a huge market potential for growth.\nSo I decided to pitch my way up until I could secure the funds.\nAfter a year of pitching, I was far from the goal (securing $400k in a third world country is nearly impossible if you are a young entrepreneur with an idea.)\nSo I started enrolling in international entrepreneurship competitions, I was able to compete in GSEA and then Hult Prize. I didn\u2019t win them, (earned a 2nd place in both) but it was enough to broaden my network with wealthy investors with deep pockets. \n\nI secured funding early 2020 and started building the fish facility in February, the Covid lockdown hit us hard and we couldn\u2019t deliver what our investor expected.\nSo legal fights came, with lawyers I couldn\u2019t afford, while managing a born-dead company, while also pitching again to secure more funds to get us out of the hole.\nOur initial investor agreed to sell his shares if given 40% ROI, paid $150k up front and semestral payments for 5 years \n\nA new investment fund gave us a loan to pay back the previous investor and additional $300k for working capital. Very high interest rate, but at least we got a runway to prove our business through time.\n\nAfter restructuring and getting rid of internal and external bad apples, we started buying, processing and selling fish in May 2021, we closed 2021 with $2m in revenue and we will close 2022 with $10m revenue, beyond supplying fish to local restaurants we also provide fresh fish (airplane delivery) to restaurants in Miami, NY, LA, frozen fish to hotel chains all over America.\nWe have healthy debts now, a good EBITDA and a growth trajectory that will put us in $100m annual revenue in less than ten years, we will keep reinvesting profits on CAPEX and OPEX to keep up with the growth trajectory.\n\nGod has been an integral part of my journey.\n\nLessons learned:\n1. Vision and Goals must be clear.\n2. The path can change, the goals can\u2019t.\n3. Having a mission is key.\n4. Hustle, Hustle, Hustle\n5. Have a great team that compliment your strengths ad weaknesses.\n\nEdit: Some redditors don\u2019t believe this, so search for\n\u201cForbes Centroamerica Abril 2022\u201d 30 promesas de los negocios, you will see my face on the cover.\n\nNew edit:\nI will start providing proof of my story on my profile so all of you skeptics can believe, this isn\u2019t for me! It\u2019s for you!!! Human confidence and trust has brought humanity to great lengths, imagine that closed mentality was the same that kept cavemen from believing that human made fire wasn\u2019t sorcery.\n\nI hope you enjoyed my story!!!",

      "title": "Supplier from Alibaba sent me samples with better quality than our actual products. What should I do?",
      "content": "I've been working with a supplier on Alibaba for over 1 year now. They are a verified factory and we do have Alibaba trade insurance on all orders. I have ordered products worth around $130k over 5 different orders in total from this supplier. On our 4th and 5th orders we recently switched to a new upgraded version of our product. Before we committed to this product we of course ordered product samples according to our specifications. We got the samples and verified them and everything was ok so we placed 2 bulk orders according to these specifications.  We finally recently received the first batch of the new products which has been sent out to a few customers now and I started noticing that the products didn't look as good as our sample products. So I ordered a few products home to myself(I'm working with a 3PL so I haven't touched the products at the warehouse). And I noticed that there is quite a big difference between the sample products we received and the actual product we got. The products have a kind of filling inside them and it seems like the sample products filling is of another material which is better than the product we bought. The weight is the same of the sample products and the actual products but the look and feel are a night and day difference between the samples and the actual products. I think the products we received are according to the order specifications but the samples we received have better material than what we ordered. So we have been tricked by them sending us better samples than what our products were supposed to be. If the samples we would have received had the same quality as the goods we got we would have not ordered these.\n\n\nWhat can we do here? Can we open a dispute for these 2 last orders or are we fucked? The problem I'm guessing is that the products we got ARE according to our specifications but the samples we received which we were told were to our specifications have better quality than our specifications. \n\n\nThe customer feedback has been quite ok on these products, we haven't gotten that many complaints but it is still not up to our standard. We want to have the best product on the market which we currently do not have due to this.\n\n\nHas anyone here been in the same situation?",

China is crazy.\n\n\n\n* China is filled with factories, most of which barely know the end product for which they make parts for. Still they are integral to the manufacturing process and will do a great job if you know how to ask them to.\n\n\n\n* Most factories are dirty, have poor/sub-par working conditions, and are located in rural districts outside the of small cities. \nhttp://imgur.com/8tVTcKS,oILFeZq (making sofas)\nhttp://imgur.com/8tVTcKS,oILFeZq#1 (coating steel frames)\nIt's not the best place for hardcore humanitarian types to visit.\n\n\n\n**FAQ**\n\n* *Should I buy from company X on Alibaba?* Probably not. It's unlikely they are the actual manufacturer. They do not have the product in stock. If you negotiate down they will find a manufacturer to lessen the quality to retain their margin. Believe it or not, factories can be very loyal, so expect a battle if you want to dump your supplier and go straight to the mfg later on. \n\n* *Should I hire a sourcing company?* If you just need one part and are not really concerned about developing more business in China, go for it. Overall, I'm not too fond of these companies. They tend to rest on the fact you don't know what you're doing. I've met sourcing experts who have never left the comforts of their major city. \n\n* *OK, so how do I source a product then?* While there isn't a silver-bullet, find someone you trust. Build a relationship over small business. Make it mutually beneficial for your company to grow. There are certainly some very motivated individuals out there.\n\n* *How do I actually import my product?* Find a freight forwarding company, preferably one that has offices near both ports. They will arrange for trucking to port, ocean freight, customs brokerage, documentation, etc. Have multiple forwarders give you line item quotes to ensure you don't get ripped off. Realistically importing a 20' container into the US will be about $2.5k-$4k (+ any import duty). \n\n",

And now I\u2019m sitting here with 8 million pesos (about $141,000) in debt, questioning everything about myself. Why do I dream so big? Why do I keep thinking I can make it? Why can\u2019t I stop?\n\nIt all started in 2019 when I opened my first physical store. I started small, renting an exhibit space to test the market, and to my surprise, it worked. I was making 50,000 pesos (around $880) a month in profit(I was selling women and kids clothing imported from China). That little success felt like validation. I thought, \u201cThis is it!\u201d So, I went all in. I took out a 1 million peso loan (about $17,650) to open a full-scale store. Renovations, stocks\u2014it all felt like the right move.\n\nAnd then COVID hit. Everything shut down, and I was forced to try online. Since I had loans to pay, I had no choice. To my surprise, the online store took off. To think that people were stuck at home, who would buy clothes for going out at a time like this. But! It was became wildly profitable\u2014more than I could have imagined. In December 2020, I hit my biggest milestone: 400,000 pesos (around $7,060) in sales in just 24 hours. I thought I had finally made it. I believed it would always be like this, that this is just the beginning and it will only get better from here.\n\nSo, I doubled down. I secured another loan to increase stock, believing that the more I had, the more I\u2019d sell(this time I was only focusing on children\u2019s clothing and shoes since that is what sold out fast). I was so optimistic, so confident. But 2021 was different. Sales slowed, and I wasn\u2019t paying attention to the numbers. I wasn\u2019t tracking my profit margins or operational costs properly. I just kept pushing forward, thinking I could turn things around if I spent more on ads. I was wrong.\n\nThe debt kept piling up. I had to shut the business down, but my family stepped in. They believed in me, and honestly, I felt like I couldn\u2019t stop. They supported me financially, encouraged me to start again. So, I took out another loan, believing that this time would be different. But it wasn\u2019t. I launched new products, and they didn\u2019t work. I shut down again. And then, because I couldn\u2019t give up, I tried again. And again. And again.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2023, my brand generated 29 million pesos (about $512,000) in sales. I spent an estimated 8 million pesos (about $141,000) on ads alone. I was able to grow my social media presence to 227k followers on facebook and 11k on instagram. I had local celebrities and influencers reaching out to me for collaboration during those times. Yet, somehow, here I am, with nothing to show for it but overwhelming debt and a heart full of regret. I have no idea where the money went. Operational costs were through the roof. At one point, I rented a warehouse for 50,000 pesos ($880) a month. I hired more employees and raised their salaries significantly because I truly believed that the success I had in December 2020 would continue forever.\n\nIt didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve shut the business down for good now. This year, I tried affiliate marketing(US based). My first month was profitable\u2014I made 60,000 pesos ($1,060). I thought, maybe this is it. Maybe I\u2019ve finally found something that works. But again, it fell apart. I ended up adding another 250,000 pesos ($4,400) to my debt(through facebook ads). Then I wrote and launched an ebook, pouring everything into it. Ads, campaigns, promotions\u2014it added another 250,000 pesos to my debt. I really thought, maybe I went through everything for this moment. I was sharing something I believed in deeply\u2014the secret supplier, the supplier of all suppliers. Profit was, of course, the first priority, but this time it felt different. I wanted to become successful while helping others achieve their success too.\n\nBut in the end, once again, it wasn\u2019t. It failed just like the rest, and the heartbreak was unbearable. I had poured my hope, my energy, and my belief into this, thinking it was finally my moment. Instead, it became another painful reminder of how far I\u2019d fallen.\n\nEvery failure has led me deeper into depression. It\u2019s heavy. So heavy. Earlier this year I took so many courses and read books on mindset. And when I tried new things, I also did it with a new mindset. And now, I\u2019m so scared to go back to the person I was before. During all those times when I was chasing success I was miserable. Stuck on survival mode that it affected how I was as a person, mom, wife, daughter and friend. At some point I\u2019m proud of the person I am now, because if I was still who I was these past years I would seriously be contemplating ending my life. And the worst part? My parents. They\u2019ve stepped in so many times, covering loans, supporting me, believing in me. They shouldn\u2019t have to. They\u2019re at an age where they should be resting, enjoying life, not worrying about their daughter\u2019s financial mess. I feel like I\u2019ve failed them spectacularly\u2014over and over again. I was supposed to retire them early, to give back after all they\u2019ve given me. Instead, I\u2019ve only added to their stress.\n\nI keep asking myself, why do I dream so big? Why can\u2019t I just accept a normal life, a stable life? Why can\u2019t I stop chasing this idea that I\u2019m meant for more? I feel like I\u2019ve been stuck in this cycle for years\u2014dreaming, failing, trying again. And now, I\u2019m at the point where I don\u2019t even know who I am without those dreams. I\u2019m tired. I feel defeated. I don\u2019t know how to move forward, but I know I can\u2019t keep going like this.\n\nTo anyone reading this: How do you let go of your dreams and accept that, no matter how deeply you knew in your heart you were meant for greatness, you\u2019re not? I\u2019m 31 years old.\n\nEDIT: \n\nI want to thank everyone who took the time and effort to comment on my post. Your empathy, insights, and advice have been incredibly valuable, and I truly appreciate the kindness and support you\u2019ve shown.\n\nFor context, I\u2019ve taken multiple courses on Facebook ads and marketing, which helped me grow my following and achieve those sales figures. My first business was actually profitable in terms of ad cost versus revenue. However, I rushed things and made decisions that weren\u2019t realistic. Looking back, if I had taken it slow, avoided loans, and been content with making 100k-300k pesos (roughly $1,800-$5,400) a day, the business might still be alive today. Unfortunately, I wanted more\u2014so I took loans, got a warehouse, and hired more employees. When sales slowed down, the loan payments piled up, and I eventually had to shut it all down last year, in 2023.\n\nThis year, I tried affiliate marketing through ClickBank (after taking another course). It was profitable at first, but like before, it eventually wasn\u2019t sustainable. I only tried two products and one MRR (Master Resell Rights) product, and while I generated significant revenue, it still wasn\u2019t enough to turn a profit overall.\n\nLastly, despite wanting to \u201cgatekeep\u201d my supplier (their value lies in being a direct Chinese platform for factories and manufacturers\u2014most sellers on Alibaba and AliExpress are just middlemen and their supplier is this supplier), my sister encouraged me to write an ebook about it since I no longer plan to sell physical products. The goal was to help others while also helping myself.\n\nMoving forward, I\u2019ve decided to focus on freelancing or virtual assistance to gain stability and work toward reducing my debt rather than adding more to it.\n\nI also want to add how grateful I am to have heard from strangers this time. It\u2019s given me a different perspective\u2014a view I couldn\u2019t see on my own.",

Lacking of excitements, perhaps its too easy, in some aspects so ..\n\nI made a leap that some might call crazy\u2014I left my $230k job in finance to start my own sourcing company in China. It's been a whirlwind of emotions, but oddly, it feels good.   \nIn finance, my days were predictable. I had set tasks, clear goals, and a pretty good idea of what my paycheck would look like at the end of the year. It was comfortable, but somewhere along the line, it started to feel a bit too... scripted. I craved something more, something that felt like my own.  \nTransitioning to running my own business was like stepping into a different world. Suddenly, there were no clear-cut tasks at the start of each day, no guaranteed paycheck waiting for me. The uncertainty was daunting. Every decision felt like a gamble. Would this supplier be reliable? Can I ensure the quality of the products? How do I manage logistics, warehousing, and especially the nuances of communication and customization with Chinese factories?   \nBut here's the thing\u2014despite the sleepless nights and the steep learning curve, there's a part of this journey that's incredibly fulfilling. For every challenge, there's a victory. For every setback, a lesson learned. The freedom to steer my own ship, to build something from the ground up, has brought a sense of accomplishment I never found in my previous job.  \nI've come to realize that the unpredictability is not a bug; it's a feature. It's what keeps me on my toes, pushes me to innovate, and forces me to grow. And while the path of a business owner is fraught with challenges  \nHere's to the weirdly good feeling of embracing the unknown.  \n",

I'm looking for more of a private agent than an own way to get to suppliers. A person that can hook me up with both drop for testing and private label for scaling. Where do I even start looking for one? I'm not really keen on looking for anyone on Reddit for that cuz \"my friend we're the best I provide for you cheap price fast shipping\" is not convincing to me. I know damn well a private agent will promise me a candy land, but I've had a 2 or 3 - one found on Reddit who turned out terrible despite promising whatnot. A person lurking for a client in every Reddit post doesn't seem to be reliable in the first place, but well, correct me if I'm wrong. \n2. Is there any other way than to simply start working with someone to determine credibility of that agent? \n3. Is it better to approach agents in Chinese than English? I've translated a few stores in the past few months and handled multilingual customer support, so I'm pretty used to using chat GPT for talking in other languages - and since the language barrier seems to be a problem quite often, I would be fine talking in Chinese, I think\n4. Will a good private agent won't even talk to me, if I don't have a certain MOQ? I know private agent is usually a next step, rather than getting one when the store is not even up - but when you want to sell products almost no one sells, or a variation of it that no one sells - you need to source it with ways out of reach for most people. So a product that's not available on Ali, or CJ, or wherever. I don't want to be the 12th guy selling the same neck massager, got dang it\n5. Are agencies better than private agents? I know they're more expensive, but what about performance?\n6. How did you find your agent, and how is it going? Tell me your story mate! ",

Also they are not straight and aligned as per the approved samples. The supplier is trying to argue a little (overall they do seem to take blame), by saying they sent photos prior to shipping.

      "title": "AI Will Make You Extremely Rich or Kill Your Business in 2024",
      "content": "**Preface:** I'm a solo-founder in the AI space and previously worked as an ML scientist; the new advancements in AI that I'm seeing are going to impact everyone here. It doesn't matter if you're just starting out, or a bootstrapped brick and mortar founder, or even a VC backed hard tech founder. Last year was when the seeds were laid, and this is the year we'll see them bloom. There will be an onslaught of advancements that take place that are borderline inconceivable due to the nature of exponential progress. This will change every single vertical.\n\nI'm making this post because I think AI execution strategy will make or break businesses. Dramatically. Over **$50B** was put into AI startups in 2023 alone. This figure excludes the hundreds of billions poured into AI from enterprises. So, let's follow the money:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1) AI enterprise software.**\n\nThere's a lot to unpack here and this is what I\u2019m currently working on. AI enterprise software will encompass everything from hyper personalized email outbound to AI cold calls to AI that A/B tests ads on synthetic data to vertical specific software. The impact of the former is relatively self explanatory, so I'll focus on the latter. To illustrate vertical specific AI software, I'll use a simple example in the legal space. Lawyers typically have to comb through thousands of pages of documents. Now, using an LLM + a VDB, an AI can instantly answer all of those questions while surfacing the source and highlighting the specific answer in the contract/document. There are dozens of AI startups for this use case alone. This saves lawyers an immense amount of time and allows them to move faster. Firms that adopt this have a fundamental advantage over law firms that don't adopt this. This was 2023 technology. I'm seeing vertical AI software getting built by my friends in areas from construction, to real estate, to even niche areas like chimney manufacturing. This will exist everywhere. Now, this can be extrapolated much further to be applicable to systems that can do reports and even browse the Internet. This brings me to my next point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2) AI information aggregation and spread.**\n\nMy gut tells me that this will have a crescendo moment in the future with hardware advancements (*Rabbit, Tab, etc.*). You won't have to google things because it will be surfaced to you. It's predictive in nature. The people who can get information the fastest will grow their business the fastest. This part is semi-speculative, but due to the nature of LLMs being so expensive to train, I have a strong feeling that large institutions will have access to the *\\*fastest\\** and *\\*best\\** models that can do this quicker than you and I can. This is why it's important to stay on top.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3) AI content generation**\n\nThis is relevant to running advertisements and any digital marketing aspect of your business. If you can rapidly make content faster than your competitors to put in social media, you will outpace your competitors rapidly. I think most folks are familiar with MidJourney, Stable diffusion, etc. but don't know how to use it. You can generate consistent models for a clothing brand or generate images of a product that you would normally need to hire a professional photographer to take. There's also elevenlabs which is relatively easy to use and can be used to make an MP3 clip as a narration for an ad; this is something I've already done. I'm also still shocked by how many people are unfamiliar with tools like [**Pika**](https://pika.art) which can do video generation. You could imagine companies having ***fleets of digital influencers*** that they control or conjuring up the perfect ad for a specific demographic using a combination of all of the aforementioned tools.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In summary,** if you feel like I'm being hyperbolic or propagating science fiction fantasies, you're likely already behind. I truly recommend that everyone stays up to date on these advancements as much as possible. If your competitor comes across an AI tool that can increase their ROAS by 5x they can crush you. If your competitor uses a tool that increases the rate at which they receive and aggregate information by 200% (modest estimate) they will crush you. If your competitors have a tool that can reduce their employee size, then they will use it. They'll fire their employees to cut costs and reinvest the money back into their business. It will compound to the point where you're outpaced, and this isn't a level of innovation we've seen since the birth of the industrial revolution. Your customers can get stolen overnight, or you can steal your competition\u2019s customers overnight.\n\n**TL;DR:** This is an opportunity for entrepreneurs to scale faster than they could have possibly imagined, but this also comes with the potential for your company to be obliterated. We've never seen advancements that can have this drastic of an impact this quickly. Adoption will happen fast, and first movers will have a disproportionate and compounding advantage. Watch guides, meet with startups, follow the news, and get rich.",

(not all products of course but many)\n\nFor example, in my mind I was going to purchase a product wholesale from a company I know and love and is in the USA thinking their products are made in the USA too... But then I learn they're just buying their products from china on Alibaba just like everyone else! Why the hell did I think sustainable and \"made in USA\" were synonymous? \n\nI guess now I just feel bad. for 1 because I'm now learning this is the world we live in when it comes to retail but also 2 because where does that leave me? Why wouldn't I skip the middle man (wholesaler) when I can just go straight to the source (china/Alibaba/whatever) for a fraction of the cost? But seeing as I'm a \"sustainable\" retailer I guess now I feel like a fraud.\n\nI'm new to this world... so if you have advice on how to source products and suppliers that focuses on sustainability and ethical practices I would love to hear it. \n\nNote: it's okay commentators you can rip me a new one. also note\\* obviously I'm not sourcing everything from china.

Answer: See Green Industrial Co LTD\n* Who are See Green Industrial Co's top customers? #1 Lululemon, #2 Gaiam & #3 Fit For Life\n\nI created ImportYeti because these bill of ladings are public information and nearly every large eCom owner or FBA seller I know uses expensive alternatives to ImportYeti that are too cost prohibitive for the small guys starting out.\n\nIt would be my  hope that people don't use this to \"copy\" competitor  products. There are already enough product clones floating around the internet.

      "title": "How I've been making over 10k / mon. since 20 (25 now)",
      "content": "Want to give some value, in particular for the younger guys, as I know how the online entrepreneur space is these days. SMMA, dropshipping, crypto, lambos, Miami, Dubai, I know what it's like to see that stuff all over the internet. All of these gurus, infoproduct guys, etc. etc. \n\nMy average month is about 20k-30k now, I do real life business, I didn't just hit it once, It has been consistent. I had a clothing brand agency, well still do, and my biggest month was about 25k Rev, but the majority of money I've made was in sales. I've tried dropshipping, SMMA, Crypto, all of it. My first sales job was as a door to door canvasser, setting free roof inspections for a roofing company at 19. I didn't want to do it, I had too much pride, always told myself I'd run my own company, be a millionaire before everyone else. I was the only kid my age at the time into self improvement, going to seminars, Tony Robbins, Gary Vee, etc. but I didn't have the vehicle to make my first money yet. I eventually lost my job, car got totaled, I was late on rent, no source of transportation and this offer came up. Long story short, I did it and made my rent that first week, which was $1,000 at the time (2018). The sales guys that were closing all made over $100k. Before you make a million, you need to surpass six figures. \n\nNow I'll get deeper into the specific industry I'm in but I want to highlight D2D, and sales in general as it relates to entrepreneurs. The entrepreneurial spirit is something some of us are born and gifted with. It is only a matter of time before you find the vehicle to express that. Entrepreneurship is a sport to a degree, but it's a mental one, not physical. There are skillsets involved, like in sports. A fighter will train to enhance his skills, speed, power, cardio, different fighting styles, boxing, BJJ, etc. I say this because as an entrepreneur, your ability to succeed depends on your strengths and weaknesses, and building your strengths is only a matter of putting in reps. No course or PDF will put reps in for you. You need to train and persistently put in those reps to enhance those skills that translate into desired outcomes and results. This is where sales comes in. D2D is unlimited entrepreneurship training, and the best part is you get paid to learn. If you started a business from scratch right now, with no experience, you'd need to sell one of two things, a product, or a service. Now in the creation of that product or service, there are skillsets involved in doing so, you have to build those, and if you want to succeed at them, you have to get good as well. In sales, its one primary skill, you're selling someone else's product or service, so you don't have to worry about the fulfillment or management of that business. Sales and marketing drive revenue simply speaking. If you can sell and market, you can profit. Where many young people, myself included, go wrong, is they hear about these business models that these guys teach, and try to manage a business that they know nothing about. They tell you how they made $10k, $100k per month. And give you a blue print of what they're doing, but you didn't put in the reps they did. If LeBron put out a course on how to shoot better, I imagine there's some value in that, but you aren't putting in LeBrons work, and with his natural gifts, so you're not going to become him. Lock in on whats in front of you and progress by mastering one thing, then learning the next skillset you know you'll need to learn on the trajectory to become a master CEO. This is the way, not chasing online trends. FB ads changes, Tik Tik changes, Instagram changes, markets get saturated. Build you. \n\nNow what is the industry I'm in? Exterior home restoration. What is that? Well basically we complete work on homes from storm damage, hail, winds, tornadoes, hurricanes, etc. and insurance pays for the work. Every home owner has insurance, and these companies pay for repairs to be completed. Like an auto body shop, if you crash a car, or got hail damage, the company pays the shop, shop does the work, and boom everyone's happy. I started setting leads, went on to closing deals, then later started project managing. Roofing was the bread and butter, but I've made the most of money so far doing niche high end windows that get damaged by hail. These windows are 5x the cost of a roof, and most contractors have no clue how to deal with the claims and install. I have an LLC and subcontracted by the contractors to generate deals. I close the deals, they complete the work. This is my business, and it works well. I get a $5k avg. per deal, and I sell a lot. If you're interested in learning more about this specific industry fire away questions or DM me, I'm more than happy to help. ",

      "title": "What I learnt from sourcing e-commerce products from China.",
      "content": "DISCLAIMER: The intention of this to increase cautiousness and practice best practices between the entrepreneurs that are importing from China. \n\nSo I have been running an e-commerce store for a very long time, not a drop-shipping particularly but we would order the products in bulk to the country and then ship from there (For faster shipping).I wanted to do drop-shipping but then it halted back in 2019, right after the COVID and ePacket was banned >!(ePacket is a shipping agreement between US and China to reduce shipping times, it uses passenger planes to carry the parcel, hence faster shipping)!<.\n\nAnyway getting back to the point, We were selling jewellery in the United States, firstly we used to just order from Aliexpress (a bunch of 500 every week) to our warehouse, do the quality check and then we would ship it from there. However the price per item was $7.80 and it was selling for $25.99 with a good profit margin.\n\nWe decided to scale that store (I shared the scaling strategy in a different blog post) by going to a supplier and ordering 10K since Q4 was coming up and we were trying to scale up, the item was selling like a hot dog. We posted a few Request For Quotation on Alibaba and got some quotations and here are my learnings.\n\n* **You will get the same product for less.**\n\nThe item we were getting for $7.80 was available for as low as $4.00 if we ordered in bulk, and as high as $10, so it varies. If you order $10K units then it will be available for $2.00. The more volume you ask for the lesser the cost will be - I mean it's normal, but the cost can go very low. I mean compare $7.80 to $2.00\n\n* **You will have to do your own quality check.**\n\nAlibaba is not like Amazon where they do the quality check for you, you will have to do your quality check before you ship the items to your customers. We ordered 10K and got around 300 defective items from the supply. (either they were broken, or of a bad quality). And then you have to send them to the supplier, the supplier will usually ask you to send the items back but it's not worth the time. So make sure that you order at least 10% more of what you need.\n\n* **Plan your shipments accordingly and choose the correct method**\n\nUnrelated to the store, we saw a great kitchen product that we thought could do really good in the American market, but the problem? It was 1.2Kgs. It was a really large item made out of stainless steel. We wanted it faster but AIR CARGO was expensive (it was charging $2000) as we did not have time since Q4 was already around the corner, however the affordable option was ship containers but the transit time was 1 month. So make sure if you plan to order large items, do it beforehand and make sure you choose the right shipping service to save costs.\n\n* **Trust your negotiation skills.**\n\nYou got to trust your negotiations skills and don't be shy when negotiating with your suppliers, we got down the per product cost from $6 to $4.80. While it may not seem a lot but it saved around $3500 per order. So negotiation works! I mean just like any other business.\n\n* **Never ditch a supplier too early.**\n\nIf you find a better price somewhere then don't move your orders at once, we got a supplier that was giving the exact same product for almost 20% less, and ordered 500 units from them. Most of the units were defective, so always maintain multiple suppliers until you do the quality check of both of the suppliers.\n\n* **Have multiple modes of communication**\n\nIf you're using Alibaba chat to communicate with your suppliers then make sure you have their emails and WhatsApp, WeChat or anything they use because they will go offline without prior notice.\n\n* **You will get free FedEX/UPS shipping**\n\nDon't hesitate to ask for premium shipping if you maintain a good relationship, the supplier we had used to send the items using ePacket which used to take 10-14 days, talked to the supplier and he offered a premium FedEX shipping for large orders which delivered the order in 4-5 days max (to California)\n\n* **Always use AliBaba Payment Gateway**\n\nNever use PayPal, or WeChat or anything else to send the funds, it's just not worth the hassle. Even though you have the escrow services at place. I would just avoid PayPal or anything and just go with Alibaba's gateway. It is seamless and has a great grievance redressal system.\n\n* **Product Sourcing Agents are great but be careful**\n\nThere are a lot of product sourcing agents are great, they will get in touch directly with the manufacturer for you and can get any type of customisation done for you and can get you better prices. But be careful and use a better sourcing agent.\n\nI guess that was it. I will edit this post if I find more points to address.",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m currently a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University. Lately, I\u2019ve become really curious about international trade, especially how small businesses in the US manage to import products from China.\n\n\n\nA bit of context: many of my friends from high school and college (some still in China) are running \u201cinternational trade\u201d businesses. To be honest, it\u2019s quite surprising to me, because most of them don\u2019t speak much English or have any background in manufacturing or supply chains. From what I\u2019ve gathered, they mostly find local Chinese products and resell them via platforms like Alibaba and Amazon.\n\n\n\nThis got me thinking\u2014how do small businesses based in the US (who are far from the source) handle product quality, customs, and communication with suppliers? Big companies have teams, lawyers, and huge purchase volumes to leverage, but small businesses seem to face more uncertainty and risk in cross-border trade.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re a small business owner or have experience sourcing from China, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. How do you make it work? Do you use sourcing agents? How do you manage quality control remotely? Any insights or stories would be greatly appreciated.",

I really appreciated the replies \u2014 super helpful!\n\nTo follow up: most of the products I\u2019m working with are under $5, which makes it tricky to justify custom packaging. Based on your advice, I started looking into OEM options and 3PL services for repackaging. Some suppliers are open to private label, but the MOQ is still a bit high for testing.\n\nIf you're selling <$10 products:\n- How do you balance packaging cost with perceived value?\n- Have you found any budget-friendly packaging strategies that still look professional?\n- Do you repack in-house or use a 3PL?\n\nThanks again \u2014 this sub has been incredibly helpful. Just trying to avoid rookie mistakes and find a sustainable workflow!",

It\u2019s just not as cost effective anymore, especially for smaller eCom stores like mine.\n\nI\u2019ve been testing out some Pod options lately\u2014mainly curious if this model could actually be more profitable long term. I saw that some platforms offer deeper discounts and sample order deals if you're doing decent volume. One of them has a \u201cGrowth Plan\u201d that gives up to 33% off, which sounds good, but I\u2019m not sure how much it really helps with margins yet.\n\nHas anyone here switched from importing to POD? Especially with personalized products? Wondering if it's worth fully committing, or if I should just ride this out. Your guidance is the most needed right now!",

      "content": "I always thought I sucked at sales.\n\nGot my first job as a telemarketer when I was 16, and I quit 6 hours into my first shift.\n\nIt was emotionally exhausting and I honestly felt disgusted.\n\nThis experience scarred me for years and held me back when I started building my freelancing business 8 years later.\n\nThen I joined an absurdly expensive mastermind ($7500 / 3 months) where they shared the initial version of the script I'm about to share with you.\n\nAnd it flipped my entire mindset about what it takes to sell on its head.\n\nInstead of being salesy, they told me to act like a doctor. Diagnose and then confidently present the cure.\n\nAfter I started doing this, I closed 200+ deals for my freelancing business. From big tech companies all the way down to small mom-and-pop online stores.\n\nHere's the script that changed everything for me:\n\n# The mindset\n\nBefore we get into the \"what to say,\" we need to fix the \"how to think.\" This is 90% of the battle.\n\n* Your job isn't to push a product; it's to diagnose a problem. You should be listening, asking intelligent questions, and determining **if you're even the right person to help them**. If a doctor listened to your symptoms for 30 seconds and immediately tried to sell you on a specific surgery, you'd run. Don't be that person.\n* In the first half of the call, the client should be doing 80% of the talking. If you're talking more than them, you're pitching, not discovering. You're losing.\n* You don't\u00a0need\u00a0this client. You are evaluating\u00a0them\u00a0just as much as they are evaluating you. Think of it like a first date. You're not trying to force a second date from the moment you sit down. You're genuinely trying to see if there's a connection and if you're compatible for a long-term relationship.\n* Do not read this word-for-word. Reading makes you sound like a robot and breaks all trust.\n\n# Preparation\n\nGood prep is going to be the source of your confidence. Knowing your questions and your offer ahead of time frees up your mental energy to actively listen.\n\n1. Go through the steps below and write down 3-5 specific questions for each section.\n2. **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Prepare 1-3 clear service packages with prices**. Even if you won\u2019t be able to pitch a productized service, this will help you quickly and without hesitation answer ANY questions regarding your pricing (e.g. \"I've done similar projects for around $4.000). This makes you look like someone who\u2019s been doing this for years, is a professional and even **allows you to close the deal on the call** instead of letting the momentum die with a \"let me get back to you with a proposal.\"\n\n**The biggest mistake most people make is to NOT talk about pricing.**\n\nTalking about pricing massively speeds up the sales process, because prospects can either accept your offer immediately, decline it, or try a delay tactic.\n\nIf they accept - then great!\n\nIf they decline or delay, you can ASK them why, and you\u2019ll find out a lot about the objections they have about working with you.\n\n# The warm-up\n\nSpending 2-3 minutes on small talk shows you\u2019re a relaxed, normal person, which helps the prospect relax, too.\n\n* What to Say:\n   * \u201cI see you're based in Austin. I've heard great things about the food scene there.\u201d\n   * \u201cI have to mention this, you picked the best Zoom background.\u201d\n   * \u201cGlad we could connect before the weekend. Any exciting plans?\u201d\n\nThen, transition and set the frame. This is crucial for taking control.\n\n* \"Awesome! Well, I\u2019m excited to chat. Should we dive right in?\"\u00a0(Wait for \"yes\")\n* \"Great. So the way I usually run these calls is I'll start by asking a few questions to get a really clear picture of your business and what you're looking for. If it sounds like I can definitely help, I\u2019ll explain how I work. Sound good?\"\n\n# Discovery\n\nThis is your \"doctor\" phase. Start broad and then go deep.\n\n* **If they reached out to you:**\u00a0\"So, to start, I\u2019d love to hear what prompted you to book this call today? What\u2019s going on in your business?\"\n* **If you reached out to them:**\u00a0\"When I reached out, something in my message must have clicked. What was it that made you decide to take this call?\"\n\nNow, shut up and listen. Take notes. After their initial answer, dig deeper with your prepared, service-specific questions.\n\n* **Pro-Tip:**\u00a0If they give short, unhelpful answers, use this:\u00a0**\"Could you tell me a bit more about that?\"**\n\n# Their experience\n\nAre you talking to a seasoned pro or a total beginner? The answer dictates how you'll pitch later on and what kind of questions to ask.\n\n* \"Have you tackled this issue before? What worked or didn\u2019t work?\"\n* \"Have you worked with another freelancer or agency on this? What was that like?\"\n\nThis tells you what they value, what they hate, and what landmines to avoid. If they say their last designer was a \"terrible communicator,\" you know to highlight your communication process in your pitch.\n\nOn the other hand if they tell you they've had 20 freelancers on this and that they all sucked, you should probably run away.\n\n# Defining success\n\nThis is where you move from their\u00a0problems\u00a0to their\u00a0aspirations.\n\n* \"Okay, let's fast forward 6 months. If we were to work together on this, what would need to have happened for you to feel like this was a huge success?\"\n* \"What would achieving \\[their goal\\] actually do for your business? Why is this a priority right now?\"\n\nWhen they answer this, they are literally selling\u00a0themselves\u00a0on the value of your service. Write down their exact words.\n\n# Uncovering roadblocks\n\nWhy their problem still exists. This is the bridge to your pitch.\n\n* \"So you\u2019re looking to achieve \\[their goal\\]. What\u2019s held you back from getting this done on your own so far?\"\n* \"Why do you think you haven't found the right person to help with this yet?\"\n\nTheir answer here is pure gold. It gives you the exact angle for your pitch.\n\n* If they say \"I don't have the time,\" your solution is about a hands-off, \"done-for-you\" process.\n* If they say \"I don't have the expertise,\" your solution is about your deep knowledge and strategic guidance.\n\n# The pitch\n\nSee how late this comes? You should only pitch after you fully understand their situation.\n\n* **Ask for permission:** \"Okay, based on everything you've told me, I have a very clear picture of the situation. I'm confident I can help you achieve \\[Their Goal\\]. Would it be okay if I walk you through how I'd approach it?\"\n* **Frame it:**\u00a0\"Great. So I specialize in helping \\[businesses like them\\] to \\[achieve the exact goal they just told you\\].\"\n* **Show proof:**\u00a0\"For example, last quarter I worked with \\[Similar Client\\], who was struggling with \\[Similar Problem\\]. We implemented this process and they were able to \\[Achieve Result\\].\"\n* **Explain the process:**\u00a0Walk them through the steps.\n   * \"First, we\u2019d start with a kickoff session to...\"\n   * \"Next, I\u2019ll prepare xyz to...\"\n   * \"Finally, you\u2019ll get...\"\n\n**IMPORTANT:** DO NOT REVEAL YOUR PRICING OR PACKAGES AT THIS POINT! Focus solely on the workflow and deliverables.\n\nAfter you're done, ask them:\n\n*  \"That\u2019s the general overview. What questions do you have about that for me?\"\n\nWhen they run out of process questions, they will almost always ask the big one: \"So... how much does it cost?\" This is the moment you've been waiting for.\n\n* \"The cost for the package I just described is $7,500.\"\n\nState your price clearly and confidently. Then, the most important part:\n\n**BE SILENT.**\n\nDo not justify it. Do not explain it. Do not say \"but we can be flexible.\" The first person who talks, loses. Let them react. Their reaction tells you everything you need to know.\n\n# Handling objections\n\nAn objection is not a \"no.\" It's a request for more information or reassurance. Don't get defensive. You can't handle an objection if you don't know what they're thinking. So your first job is to figure out what they're trying to say.\n\n**\"That's more expensive than I was expecting\"**\n\n* \"I understand. Can I ask what you were budgeting for a project like this?\"\u00a0OR\u00a0\"Could you tell me a bit more about what makes it feel expensive?\"\u00a0(This helps you understand if it's a value problem or a cash flow problem).\n\n**\"I need to think about it.\"**\n\n* \"That\u2019s perfectly fine; most of my best clients take time to think. Just so I can understand, what specific part of it do you need to think about most?\"\n\n**\"Why would I pay this much when I can get someone on Fiverr for $500?\"**\n\n* \"That's a fair question. You're right, there are definitely cheaper options out there, and for simple tasks, they can be great. The question is, are you looking to buy a task, or are you looking to buy a business outcome? A task-doer will do exactly what you say. I see my role as a strategic partner to help you achieve \\[their goal\\]. Which of those is more important to you right now?\"\n\n(I've got more objections and how to handle them in the google docs I'm linking below)\n\n# The close\n\nIf they agree with your price and want to move forward, you're not done yet. You need to handle the final step professionally.\n\n* Immediately explain the next steps.\u00a0\"Great! Here\u2019s what will happen next. I'm going to send over the contract and an invoice for the initial deposit. Once that's handled, I'll send you a link to book our kickoff call.\"\n* Don't just hang up after that! Spend 2-3 minutes returning to small talk. This calms their nerves, eases potential buyer's remorse, and reinforces that you're a human they're building a relationship with, not just a vendor who got their money.\n\n# Extra info\n\nI've put some extra objection handling examples, more info, more examples, etc. into a Google Doc which I'm linking in a comment below, to keep this post on point.  \n  \nThis all takes practice to master so I also created a ChatGPT Monster prompt that will roleplay different levels of clients (easy to hard). I'm also including it at the bottom of the doc.  \n",

      "content": "Hey /r/entrepeneur Cory here from Woodies.   **Thanks for the Gold!**\n\nI just read the post about some guy un-subbing because of all the click-bait, shit-posts, so now that he's gone, I thought I'd contribute really helpful content!\n\nWhile making this list, I cannot believe how many freaking services I use, it's kind of ridiculous, I probably need to cancel a few.  \n\nI've been running Woodies for 5 years now, and my vision has become clear.  I want to make as much money as possible while maintaining complete control of my business.  I have no employees, I have no partners.  I'm on track to *hopefully* do a million in revenue this year.\n\nI'm looking for anything that saves me time.  I'm a graduate of the four-hour workweek school of thought and my goal is to outsource everything I can, and automate everything that allows me to multiply my efforts.  \n\nHere is the full list of apps and SaaS that I use to run Woodies:\n\n[***Shopify***](http://shopify.com):  The alpha dog in the ecommerce space\n\n***Shopify Apps***:\n\n***[Login with Amazon](https://apps.shopify.com/login-with-amazon)***:  60% of traffic comes from mobile but only 20% of checkouts, why?  Because it's hard to enter your info, this allows people to login with their Amazon account, choose their address, choose their payment method and boom they're checked out.  Great app\n\n***[Make an Offer](https://apps.shopify.com/make-an-offer)***:  Exit-intent pop-up that allows customers to submit an offer for a product they wanted, they give their email, I use Zapier to shoot them a discount code and to add their email to Mailchimp\n\n***[ShopiMap](https://apps.shopify.com/shopimap)***:  It puts a pin on every customer and shows what they ordered.  Great for social proof.  [Here's mine for Woodies](https://woodies.com/pages/who-wears-woodies)\n\n***[CovetPics](https://apps.shopify.com/covet-pics)***:  Cool Instagram plug-in that makes a collage from my Instagram account and integrates the photos on each product page\n\n[***Yotpo***](http://yotpo.com):  I was lucky to get them while they cost $30/month  now it costs like $300 a month to collect reviews.  It's a really great app though, it auto-sends review requests and displays them on product pages.  I wish they picked a better name, Yotpo is kinda lame\n\n***[Spently](https://apps.shopify.com/spently)***:  I use them for sending out sweet order confirmation emails. The default ones from Shopify are pretty boring, these are awesome, shout to Nick!\n\n***[Compass.Co](http://compass.co)***:  The best ecommerce analytics I've seen, they integrate with all my sales channels and pull in more information than I knew I had and organize it neatly\n\n[***Amazon:***](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/homepage.html)  My number one sales platform, responsible for over 60% of my sales\n\n***Customer Service***:  This is VERY IMPORTANT.  Luckily, I pay my mom a monthly rate to perform this valuable service.  ([*thanks mom!*](https://woodies.com/pages/contact))  Unfortunately, you can't use her!  You CAN use someone else's mom however, the website [HireMyMom](https://www.hiremymom.com/) (queue all the reddit jokes)  We all know mom's are awesome, they're usually consistent, reliable, and friendly.  For VA's, mom's are #1\n\n[***AmazonFBA***](https://services.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon/benefits.htm):  The service that receives, stores, packs, and ships 100% of my products.  Without this service, I wouldn't be able to travel full-time, I'd need to rent a warehouse, hire workers, and the rest\n\n***[Amazon Affiliates](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/welcome)***:  I sell on Shopify and Amazon, but I understand there are people out there who just LOVE Amazon Prime, so they go to my site, find a product they like, then want to buy it Amazon, I don't blame them, I would prefer free shipping also.  SO on each of my product pages, I include a link to my product listing on Amazon, I use an affiliate link so that I make like 1% of the order.  It adds up to only like $100/month, but it's better than nothing.  ***See an example: [Woodies Zebrawood Sunglasses](https://woodies.com/collections/bamboo-wood-sunglasses/products/zebra-wood-aviator-wrap-sunglasses)*** *warning: affiliate link on next page*\n\nAmazon Apps:\n\n[***FeedbackGenius***](https://www.feedbackgenius.com/):  Sends automatic feedback requests to hundreds of orders per day, reviews are so valuable on Amazon that this app pays for itself many times over\n\n***[HelloProfit](http://helloprofit.com)***:  I started realizing how many different services I use and I went in a cancelled this one, $79 a month just to make the reports section of Amazon look better, not worth it\n\nWebsite:  \n\n[***Cloudflare***](https://www.cloudflare.com):  Supposedly makes my website faster, I have no idea honestly how this works, might be wasting $20/month, can anyone chime in here??  \n\n***[Typeform](http://typeform.com)***:  Awesome way to use forms.  I use them to collect information from giveaways.  \n\n***[Zapier](http://zapier.com)***:  Works well with Typeform to transfer data in between services like Gmail - Typeform - GoogleDocs - Mailchimp - Shopify.  Example, customer buys thing, Shopify tells Gmail, Gmail sends Email with Typeform, Shopify tells Mailchimp, Mailchimp adds to segment, Customer fills out Typeform, Typeform tells Mailchimp to send out Gmail, wait what?  It gets complicated\n\n***[GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com)***:  Probably not the best out there, but whatever it works fine, never had a problem\n\nTask Management:\n\n***[Gmail](http://gmail.com)***: I try to only check it twice a day, and my absolute goal is [Inbox Zero](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/inbox-zero)\n\n*Pro-tip*  [Learn all the Gmail keyboard shortcuts](https://www.shortcutworld.com/en/mac/Gmail.html)  \n\n*Pro-tip 2*  Enable Send+Archive in Gmail Settings and set it up to automatically open your next email\n\n[***Inbox Pause***](http://inboxpause.com/):  Helps me stick to my twice a day 'batching' of emails.  Pauses my email flow after I enable it.  This is to prevent that nasty habit of working on a tough task, then switching to gmail so I can answer 2-3 'easy' emails\n\n***[Trello](http://Trello.com)***:  In my never-ending pursuit of Inbox Zero, I have rules for when I encounter a batch of emails:\n\n* If I can respond within 1-2 minutes, I respond\n\n* If it would take me more than 2 minutes, I create a task on Trello\n\n***Gmail Timer Logs:***  Automatically starts a timer whenever I open a new email\n\n***Chrome Extensions:***\n\n***[LastPASS](http://lastpass.com)***:  Saves all my passwords, auto-login, and form-fills my payment methods. Pro-tip: save info from one CC to use online only and then cut it up, nothing is more frustrating than losing my card at the bar and having to reset 20 different subscriptions\n\n[***Block Site***](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh?hl=en):  The best website blocker I've used.  Simple, works, and enough of a pain to disable that I usually don't bother\n\n[***The Great Suspender***](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg?hl=en):  When I work, I usually have 15-20 tabs open at a time, this suspends the background tabs so the open ones run faster\n\n***[AMZ Seller Browser](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amz-seller-browser/klgpelgeohjghmccooegimcfhanlnngc?hl=en)***:  Let's me easily see Price History and Sales Rank on Amazon to help me keep track of competition\n\n***[Alexa Traffic](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/alexa-traffic-rank/cknebhggccemgcnbidipinkifmmegdel?hl=en)*** + ***[Similarweb](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/similarweb-website-rankin/hoklmmgfnpapgjgcpechhaamimifchmp?hl=en)***:  Helps me quickly assess how much traffic any site gets.

      "title": "Alibaba Hacks: The most efficient way to find suppliers on the biggest sourcing website",
      "content": "After releasing the [Import Bible (64 pages free ebook on sourcing)](http://importdojo.com) some people wanted to know my workflow how I use Alibaba to cut down the time to find quality suppliers.\n\nI made a [20 minute screencast](http://importdojo.com/alibaba-hacks/) you can watch over here or for the basic outline of what I do, simply read below.\n\nFor the general sourcing workflow have a look at my previous [case study I posted on /r/entrepreneur few weeks ago here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/34x4l5/case_study_importing_a_power_bank_from_china_all/)\n\n**Today you want to source for an action camera, similar to the GoPro cameras.**\n\nYou can start by going to the main page of Alibaba.com and input **\u201caction camera\u201d** in the search option.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/TAfSglm\n\nOk, so you found 106,946 products. At this point you want to filter your results for the most relevant suppliers. You will definitely want the suppliers to be:\n\n**Gold suppliers:**\n\nThis is a paid membership from Alibaba for the supplier. They get featured and can put up a lot more items in their catalogue (among other functions).\n\n**Onsite Checked:**\n\nThe onsite operation of the factory has been checked by Alibaba and a third party confirmed its legal existence.\n\n**Assessed suppliers:**\n\nThis is a third-party assessment usually done through a testing company to verify various parts of the company. This includes machinery, staff, engineers, workers, certification, and much more.\n\nAfter you have filtered for this you are down to 8,258 products:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/tv8C48r\n\n**Insider tip:**\n\nNow you filter down to the relevant manufacturing province. Why? Because each province in China is specific for different product categories.\n\nIf you find a few suppliers (compared to hundreds in other provinces) on Alibaba in a certain region it is almost 100% certain they are a trading company. They either buy this certain product from somewhere else to round up their product catalogue (95% in all cases) or they are really manufacturing it.\n\nBut even if they are manufacturing it in their region they are likely less attractive in terms of prices, less experienced in manufacturing this product and their raw material suppliers are also somewhere far away. Ultimately making them less competitive.\n\nThere are several reasons why you will find suppliers for a specific product settled within a province.\n\n* The infrastructure for this product is good. Meaning there are a lot of suppliers in the area supplying components for the suppliers end-product\n* The workers in this area are skilled in producing this specific product. Making it easier to manufacture the end-product. Most likely, this also improves the overall quality.\n* The province has favourable tax rates for the factory on certain products.\nNow lets look at this again. Even though you didn\u2019t know the province and where the product is mainly manufactured you can get some insights on this very easily:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Nz546Eg\n\nGuangdong province has a total of 7,766 suppliers for this product. The other provinces have only a few. So you filter by this province.\n\nNow, you are looking to buy small quantities, lets say 10 pieces to start. You can filter the supplier by MOQ now:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Ctt6PcF\n\nNow lets look at the specific suppliers. You scroll down and by hovering over the Gold supplier symbol you will see quick facts. You are basically looking for a factory that has experience in your market. This specific supplier has experience in North America, Western & Eastern Europe.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/4hP6OFi\n\n**Insider tip:**\n\nYou will want a supplier who has experience in these markets because he is probably aware of specific country requirements & regulations.\nThis helps because he may already have applied for certificates for this product that you need when importing.\n\nNow look at the product page. What does the page tell you?\n\nhttp://imgur.com/hNs5zmX\n\nYou will find the following:\n\n* Supplier has 5 year \u201cGOLD\u201d membership, which is a good sign. If he had scammed someone before Alibaba would have deleted his account and not renewed it for 5 years.\n* Price is within a reasonable range\n* Your desired MOQ can be met (10 pieces)\n* Payment terms are acceptable. I would go for PayPal at this amount.\n* The company is rather young but that doesn\u2019t matter. These type of camera\u2019s got really popular around 2012 so a company that has been in that field prior to that has actually a lot of experience.\n\n**Insider tip: The trick here is to think outside the box.**\n\nDon\u2019t only look at a supplier and try to find some issue or problem. Think about the product too. Ask yourself questions such as \u201cdoes his product portfolio make sense\u201d? Is it in line with his other products? Or as for example the last point above, \u201cwhen did these things get popular\u201d?.\n\nNow when you scroll down there are several more good indicators. For example good product photos. **You will want a supplier that can send you high-resolution photos for your packaging or private label.**\n\nhttp://imgur.com/WmRb1Um\n\nYou will see available certifications. In this case what matters are **RoHS**, **CE** & **FCC**.\n\n**RoHs** certification is necessary for most European countries & the Americas. It prohibits certain hazardous material within the product.\n**CE** is a certification for Europe to meet general standards. Its good if a supplier has this\n**FCC** is a required certification on electrical products & also a standard for the US.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/nxdQZLx\n\nYou could already feel comfortable with this supplier, but you should check further on him in person by email.\n\nNext, click on the \u201ccontact details\u201d where you will find several things that help you to evaluate the supplier further.\n\nLook at the company profile and what you can find there.\n\nAlso look at the website outside Alibaba. If you cannot find his website outside Alibaba then google his company name and try to find it that way.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/20bfi7z\n\nWhen you look at the website, pay attention on what products they manufacture. If the seller advertises cameras on Alibaba and his main products outside Alibaba are pillows then you will know they are only trading the cameras and you should look for a new supplier at this stage.\n\nBut, this supplier has mainly cameras in their assortment. Looks good so far.\n\nWhat you notice is that their address is different than the one on Alibaba. At this stage it is probably their Hong Kong office that they use to invoice their customers. Many factories in China have a company in Hong Kong for tax and banking reasons. No need to be worried at this stage.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/CR0IOH1\n\nGoing back to Alibaba, you will want to contact the supplier with your request now. You need to sign in to Alibaba to send a message.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/l9Q1Y1f\n\nBasically you want to ask for a price, MOQ, delivery time and to which customers he is selling this item too. Obviously you also need to do routine checks on factory standards, product certifications and supplier profiles. If you would order from this factory later you should also look into having an inspection by a third-party.\n\nHere is what the inquiry could look like:\n\n*Hi\u2026,*\n\n*My name is \u2026.. and I am the \u2026.(Manager/President/Buyer etc.) of \u2026. Limited/Inc.*\n\n*We are a (fill in your company\u2019s business, e.g., Importer/Buying Office/Whole seller/Online shop) and are operating in (fill in your country).*\n*You can also check out our website: www. \u2026..*\n\n*I am writing you today to inquire about a product I saw on your website/catalogue/exhibition.*\n\n*Here is a link to the product I am looking for:*\n\n*http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Wifi-Sport-Camera-Wifi-Action-Camera_1880459810.html*\n\n*Could you please give me the following information:*\n\n*Unit price based on 10 Pieces*\n*Minimum Order Quantity*\n*Available certification (CE, RoHS, FCC, GS, etc.)*\n*Production lead time*\n*Available colors*\n*Payment terms*\n*You can fill in the details in the attached quotation format or send me your quotation in the first step. Then I will evaluate your offer and get back to* *you as soon as possible.*\n\n*If you have any questions please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me.*\n\n*Thanks and best regards,*\n\nYou should now repeat this step and send an inquiry to at least 3 more companies on Alibaba.\n\nIf he didn\u2019t follow up on all your questions make sure to email him back and ask again.\n\nFor example if you need to know about certifications and they didn\u2019t reply to that, ask them.\n\n**Insider tip:**\n\nSometimes suppliers put all available certifications on Alibaba but they don\u2019t tell you that they charge extra for them. A RoHS, CE or FCC certification can cost from 200USD up.\n\nAsk to see copies of certificates.\n\n* Do the certificates match up with the article number that the supplier gave you? \u2014 > If not, ask about it\n* Is the certificate expired? \u2014 > If yes, ask if he would renew once order is placed.\n* Who issued the certificate? \u2014 > If it is a local Chinese company google them and see what you can find about their service.\n* If they don\u2019t have certificates yet, ask them if they could apply for them once you place an order.\n\nMake sure you tell them that you will not release any payments if the certificates are not available upon shipment. If you book an inspection company, make sure to instruct your inspection company to check on this.\n\nOnce you received the suppliers feedback it is time to follow up with him on samples.\n\nFor more details on how to order & test your samples properly check my other articles:\n[Here](http://importdojo.com/sample-communication-with-your-suppliers-an-in-depth-guide/)\n&\n[Here](http://importdojo.com/testing-your-samples/)\n\nOther tips for Alibaba:\n\n**AliSource Pro**\nThere is a rather new service called AliSource Pro. You can basically send quotation requests to thousands of suppliers.\n\nHere is what it looks like:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/9sgvuHo\n\nYou can input all product details and submit. Within a few hours you should have a couple of offers.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Xu1STHk\n\nThe downside to this is that there is not much filtering. Random suppliers will send you offers and some of them don\u2019t even match your inquiry. I suggest filling in as many details as possible and then going trough the whole process of filtering & scanning a supplier as described above.\n\n**Google the supplier**\n\nIf you cannot find much about the supplier on Alibaba, Google the suppliers name and see what you can find. Perhaps even try \u201csupplier name forums\u201d.\nThat way you maybe find something (positive or negative) in forums about the supplier.\n\nThese are the basics of sourcing on Alibaba, of course there is more to that. [I provide plenty of information for free on my blog](http://importdojo.com) that will get you started. There is no need to delay getting into this business, with all the tools available these days everyone can start importing from overseas and building their own brand.\n\n",

They have it good.\u201d\n\nYet every single behemoth in existence once had to court its first customer.\n\n[In this post](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/how-to-get-first-customers/), I feature some of their stories. You\u2019ll find in them a generous mix of grunt work, guts, and genius.\n\n**1 & 2: Tinder and Alibaba \u2013 physically traveled to their first users**\n\n*Tinder went from 5,000 to 15,000 users by getting sorority girls to signup on the spot*\n\nCrucial to [Tinder\u2019s success](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/how-tinder-obtained-more-than-50-million-users-through-word-of-mouth/) was then-CMO Whitney Wolfe\u2019s ideas for building an early user-base. She planned a tour that would take her to prominent college campuses around the country.\n\n- She would go to chapters of her sorority, do her presentation, and have all the girls at the meetings install the app.\n- Then she\u2019d go to the corresponding brother fraternity\u2014they\u2019d open the app and see all these cute girls they knew.\n- Tinder had fewer than 5,000 users before Wolfe made her trip. When she returned, there were some 15,000.\u201d\n\n*Alibaba \u201cbrute-forced\u201d its success by visiting factories one by one*\n\nBack in the early \u201900s,  Jack Ma sent out a large sales force to fan out across the country, visiting factories one by one to show them how they could use Alibaba and Taobao to sell stuff online.\n\nBack then, a large number of factories in China weren\u2019t used to working with other people online, and sometimes didn\u2019t even have computers or Internet.\n\nIt was hard work, but companies quickly flocked to Alibaba and its holdings. This allowed them to get an edge over eBay.\n\n**3 & 4: Quora and Reddit \u2013 seeded their sites with their own content**\n\n*Founders solved the chicken-and-egg problem by contributing the bulk of early content themselves*\n\n[Quora](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/quora-marketing-strategy/) and Reddit are two of the largest online forums in existence today, but they were once ghost towns with the chicken-and-egg problem of \u201cempty site = no users / no users = empty site\u201d.\n\nQuora co-founders D\u2019Angelo, Cheever and Cox wrote most of the earliest questions and answers themselves. The first employees and beta testers then continued this trend, until the platform generated enough activity for them to stop.\n\nReddit did the same, but it also created fake profiles. According co-founder Steve Huffman, it took several months before the front page would fill up organically without their submissions.\n\n**5 & 6: Threadless and Dropbox \u2013 the biggest believers in word-of-mouth**\n\n*Dropbox launched shared folders and a massive referral campaign*\n\nThe Dropbox empire was built on referrals.\n\n- With its massive word of mouth campaign, Dropbox grew its user base by 40 times \u2013 from 100,000 to 4,000,000.\n- In April 2010 alone, Dropbox users sent 2.8 million direct referral invites.\n- But on top of that, Dropbox itself was designed to encourage sharing. They introduced shared folders, a nifty feature that encouraged users to invite others to share access to folders.\n\n*Threadless let its community run their own initiatives*\n\nOne of Threadless\u2019 crucial early moves was to start a massive word-of-mouth campaign.\n\nFrom the get-go, [Threadless supported community](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/threadless-marketing-strategy/) initiated \u201crogue contests\u201d(spontaneous, themed tee shirt contests).\n\nIn turn, its community is insanely creative, and also fiercely loyal brand advocates.\n\n**7: Black Milk: Fashion + Fandoms = Great Success!**\n\nThe clothing store achieved its impressive growth by milking fandom for its worth. It didn\u2019t stop at making pop culture-inspired apparel \u2013 it established serious legitimacy by getting official license for all their geeky wear.\n\nIt\u2019s also made its Facebook page a fandom watering hole. Over there, dedicated \u201cSharkies\u201d can connect with like-minded fans.\n\nThere\u2019s even a Black Milk-approved group where girls can swap, buy, and sell their purchases with each other.\n\n**8: OKCupid \u2013 legendary content on OKTrends averaged 4,222 tweets per post**\n\nThe content on OKTrends was so mindblowingly insightful that people actually despaired when it was discontinued. Who wouldn\u2019t want to read and share this post titled \u201c10 Charts About Sex\u201c? (Do it, it\u2019s worth all your attention.)\n\nFrom August 2010 to April 2011, OkTrends posts averaged a staggering 32,500 Facebook likes and 4,222 tweets.\n\nCo-founder Rudder says, \u201cHonestly I think the blog\u2013one way or another\u2013has driven a lot of our growth. Certainly, it has driven brand awareness. It\u2019s been the only thing we\u2019ve ever done, other than making a great dating site, that has gotten us out there into the world.\u201d\n\n**9: Etsy \u2013 harvested interest by reaching out to target communities before launching**\n\n[Etsy founders](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/etsy-marketing-strategy/) used to run a web design shop and were working on getcrafty.com for one of their projects, during which they discovered the need for a marketplace for handmade crafts.\n\nSo, while they built Etsy, they reached out to the craft community on getcrafty.com and Craftster.org, which had an even larger user base.\n\nBy the time they launched, they already had a lot of interest generated among the two platforms, and that helped get the required inventory and start off transactions on Etsy.\n\n**10: Buffer \u2013 got to 100k users primarily through frequent guest blogging**\n\nCo-founder Leo Wildrich wrote 150 guest posts in the first 9 months of running Buffer, and he swears by it. That\u2019s 16-17 posts per month, or more than 1 every two days!\n\n\u201cRelationships are actually the most valuable things that you gain from guest posting. At the end of the day, if you do a lot of guest posting you simply make a lot of friends. I\u2019ve got great friends over at Treehouse, Social Media Examiner, SocialMouths, and other great sites. You provide someone with free content, that\u2019s a great favor if you think about it, so it\u2019s a great opportunity to make friends with these awesome people.\u201d\n\n**11: ASOS \u2013 the ecommerce store mailed its own print magazine to 400,000 customers**\n\nBack in 2006, CEO Nick Robertson insisted that the glossy print catalog was still key to making the brand an essential part of customers\u2019 lives. Today, besides maintaining a content-rich site, ASOS also has a magazine with a circulation of 456,000 \u2013 the 18th largest in the UK, immediately behind Glamour and Closer, and just a handful of places behind New.\n\nUnconditional, free shipping was irresistable.\n\nOne of the things that kept customers flocking to ASOS was its incredible shipping and returns policy \u2013 even in its early days, ASOS was shipping for free and without minimum purchase. That policy has only just recently changed, but ASOS already has a loyal fanbase worldwide.\n\n**12 & 13: Twitter and Foursquare \u2013 exploded their userbases at SXSW with guerrilla marketing**\n\n*SXSW 2007 \u2013 Twitter lived streamed the conference on huge plasma screens*\n\nCo-founder Evan Williams decided to visualize the service on 60 inch plasma screens in the hallways, because \u201cWe knew hallways were where the action was\u201d. Twitter created an event-specific feature that allowed attendees to follow a handful of \u201cambassadors\u201d.\n\nAccording to Newsweek\u2019s Steven Levy, \u201cHundreds of conference-goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters. Panelists and speakers mentioned the service, and the bloggers in attendance touted it.\u201d During the event, Twitter usage went from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000.\n\n*Foursquare \u2013 grew average check-ins from 250k to 350k with just chalk and rubber balls*\n\nFoursquare didn\u2019t have a booth like most other brands at the 2010 SXSW convention. Neither did it have Twitter\u2019s marketing budget (Twitter spent $11k on its SXSW campaign). Instead, it set up an actual game of \u201cfour square\u201d in front of the convention hall, which involved just chalk and two rubber balls.\n\nThe game drew thousands of walk-up participants [1], Said CEO Dennis Crowley, \u201cWe played all day long, and there was always a waiting line. We were handing out tee shirts, buttons, and stickers. Anytime someone didn\u2019t know what Foursquare was, we helped them find it on their phone. We helped get them up and running and using it.\u201d\n\n**14: Taskrabbit \u2013 focused on delighting moms in Boston**\n\nTaskrabbit first cornered the market with one mothers\u2019 group in Boston\n\nTaskrabbit is similar to Uber in its hyperlocal focus. Leah Busque talked about Taskrabbit\u2019s early traction in response to a question \u201cHow did you acquire your first 10,000 users?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can be tempting to just go really broad, really wide scale, really fast. But for us, we just focused on a customer segment. We focused on this mothers\u2019 group in Boston. And once we had cornered that market with that moms\u2019 group, those moms were talking to other moms on Beacon Hill and Backbay and Cambridge and it just spread from there.\u201d\n\n**15: Airbnb \u2013 shuttled from coast to coast to talk to their first users**\n\n*Founders went the extra mile for their earliest users*\n\nFounders Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk and Joe Gebbia acted on Paul Graham\u2019s advice in their Y Combinator days and \u201cdid things that didn\u2019t scale\u201d. Specifically, they went to NYC to acquire their earliest users, then followed up with them extensively.\n\n\u201cWhen New York took off, we flew back every weekend. We went door to door with cameras taking pictures of all these apartments to put them online. I lived in their living rooms. And home by home, block by block, communities started growing. And people would visit New York and bring the idea back with them to their city.\u201d \u2013 Brian Chesky, for The Atlantic\n\n\u201cBecause of the Democratic National Conventions, some people were using the site in New York and listing places. We would reach out to the very few people we had and get to know them, figure out what products they needed and what we could offer them. We tried to build loyalty knowing that if we did that, they would tell their friends. We\u2019d host parties and meetups and all sorts of different things. \n\nThrough that process, they\u2019d get very excited and tell their friends about Airbnb. It was mostly about generating as much buzz and excitement to get them to tell their friends about us.\u201d \u2013 Chesky, Startups Open-sourced\n\n*Airbnb believed in generating word-of-mouth, which would attract the press, which would generate more word-of-mouth*\n\n\u201cWe never dressed up in gorilla suits but we passed out fliers in coffee shops, train stations\u2014we did all sorts of things. I don\u2019t know what tactics worked more than others, but I think press was always the number one tactic for us. The press would spark another group of users, then we\u2019d go visit those people and talk to them and get them excited. It was a pattern that repeated itself.\u201d \u2013 Chesky, Startups Open-sourced\n\n**16: Yelp \u2013 grew a loyal user base by rewarding quality reviews**\n\n*Gave \u201cKudos\u201d for good behavior*\n\nYelp wanted to create a tight community of consistent reviewers and high quality reviews. It rightly guessed that people were more likely to write in-depth, well crafted reviews when their names appeared alongside them. So it offered special recognition to users who were first to review a business, and let other users give kudos for reviews that are useful, funny, or cool.\n\nAnd the numbers in 2006 show that most Yelp reviewers got hooked on the site:\n\nUsers who contributed 6 or more reviews:\n\nCitySearch \u2013 4.8%\nYahoo Local \u2013 11.1%\nYelp \u2013 65.8%\nUsers who left only one review:\n\nCitySearch \u2013 71.2%\nYahoo Local \u2013 56.4%\nYelp \u2013 9.2%\n\n*Treated their best \u201cElite\u201d users generously*\n\nThe most engaged Yelp users are elevated to \u201cElite\u201d status, visible by a shiny Elite badge on their account profile. By 2006, a full 44% of reviews on the site were contributed by Yelp Elite. \n\nDave Kim, a six-year Yelp Elite user with over 900 reviews, explains:\n\n\u201cYelp does a good job of finding ways to reward people, not through monetary means, but little perks \u2026 At regular Yelp Events, Elites often got first-chance to RSVP and even got in an hour before everyone else. There are specific events just for Yelp Elite that offer free food and drinks and swag.\u201d\n\n**17: Groove \u2013 reached out to the customers that \u201cgot away\u201d**\n\nCEO Alex Turnbull has written a very detailed analysis of Groove\u2019s early customer acquisition tactics, along the theme of doing things that don\u2019t scale.

      "title": "I became a self made millionaire at 25 in a third world country. I will share my story here:",
      "content": "I am from Central America, a tropical region with lots of poverty and problems.\nSince I was a kid, I had the drive to put extra effort on achieving something. I started selling bananas to construction workers at 7 later selling candy to schoolmates at 10.\n\nAt 15 I decided to study business and become either an over achiever employee or a business owner, at that time I didn\u2019t exactly know which path to take.\nWhile I was in university (BA studies), I noticed I had a lot of spare time after school, so instead of wasting my time on leisure, I decided to start a business, I had no clue of which kind of business start (also to start one that didn\u2019t require much money because I had none.) I met with fellow classmates that were smart and also wanted to stand out, so together we decided to start a coffee distribution company. \n\nWe were offering coffee to restaurants and hotels but competition was very tough and we just couldn\u2019t close deals to get to break even. I started noticing the first signs of a red ocean industry and how tough it is to stand out in that kind of industry. My cofounders were not putting the same effort as I was, and that frustrated me. At a point my dorm served as the company\u2019s warehouse, packing center and distribution center, I was closing almost all of the sales with clients and also doing the delivery. I noticed many companies offered high quality coffee but only a few offered high quality tea. Also in my region (a coffee growing region) there are a lot of coffee sellers as we live in a coffee growing country. Tea was always imported from Asia and few companies actually focused on it. I noticed there was an opportunity on focusing on tea, instead of coffee. \n\nI offered my cofounders to buy their shares and they agreed (for them it was a relief) so I started sourcing tea that was grown locally and mixing it with herbs, spiced and fruits to create tasty tea blends. The product was very good and without competitors, so I went to Mcdonald\u2019s HQ and offered the product for Mccafe. Mcdonald\u2019s loved the product and agreed on the price (they also liked that I was very young). My tea processing was being done at my dorm so I lacked all the licenses required to supply at Mcdonald\u2019s standards, so I was very sincere with the Supply Chain director and told him I had all the desire but lacked the money to build the proper tea facility. I offered him teapots and with the teapot earnings I could buy the machinery and equipment required to supply them properly and also to get the sanitary approvals. He agreed on the teapots and gave me a 50% advance ($50k) for them. I bought 5,000 teapots in Alibaba (China) for $3 each and sold them at $20 to Mccafe. I used all the profits to build the facility and it took me almost one year to finally start supplying Mcdonald\u2019s.\n\n\nWhile I was already supplying them, I noticed the tea market was very small (a Blue Ocean kind, but actually a blue pond) \nMy ambitious goals (become a billionaire at 35) would be tough to reach staying exclusively in the tea industry.\nI kept hustling for two years on the tea, until an opportunity came to me (or I came to it).\n\n\nWhile I was offering tea to a sushi restaurant, out of curiosity, asked if the fish served there was locally caught.\nThe owner said; \u201cNo, it comes from Asia because local fish has bad quality and I can\u2019t risk my restaurant\u2019s reputation or client\u2019s health giving them bad quality fish.\u201d\n\nIt startled me that local restaurants didn\u2019t use local fish even though we have plenty access to both Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. Seemed like an obvious problem, so I started to find out why, what asians did right and what us, central americans did wrong.\n\nAfter months of obsessive research, the problem was lack of knowledge and investment in the local fishing industry resulting in fisherman living in poverty conditions with no ability to supply high quality fish. The solution was to teach them good practices and invest in a high quality seafood processing facility, the cost of the solution was over $400,000 in investment money that I didn\u2019t had.\n\n\nSo I decided to build a team, test out our theory and provide the product to restaurants and learn form their feedback. It was a lean start up mentality to start small and cheap to prove the business thesis. We received excellent feedback and real purchase interest from restaurants.\nThat was enough to know it was a great opportunity and also a huge market potential for growth.\nSo I decided to pitch my way up until I could secure the funds.\nAfter a year of pitching, I was far from the goal (securing $400k in a third world country is nearly impossible if you are a young entrepreneur with an idea.)\nSo I started enrolling in international entrepreneurship competitions, I was able to compete in GSEA and then Hult Prize. I didn\u2019t win them, (earned a 2nd place in both) but it was enough to broaden my network with wealthy investors with deep pockets. \n\nI secured funding early 2020 and started building the fish facility in February, the Covid lockdown hit us hard and we couldn\u2019t deliver what our investor expected.\nSo legal fights came, with lawyers I couldn\u2019t afford, while managing a born-dead company, while also pitching again to secure more funds to get us out of the hole.\nOur initial investor agreed to sell his shares if given 40% ROI, paid $150k up front and semestral payments for 5 years \n\nA new investment fund gave us a loan to pay back the previous investor and additional $300k for working capital. Very high interest rate, but at least we got a runway to prove our business through time.\n\nAfter restructuring and getting rid of internal and external bad apples, we started buying, processing and selling fish in May 2021, we closed 2021 with $2m in revenue and we will close 2022 with $10m revenue, beyond supplying fish to local restaurants we also provide fresh fish (airplane delivery) to restaurants in Miami, NY, LA, frozen fish to hotel chains all over America.\nWe have healthy debts now, a good EBITDA and a growth trajectory that will put us in $100m annual revenue in less than ten years, we will keep reinvesting profits on CAPEX and OPEX to keep up with the growth trajectory.\n\nGod has been an integral part of my journey.\n\nLessons learned:\n1. Vision and Goals must be clear.\n2. The path can change, the goals can\u2019t.\n3. Having a mission is key.\n4. Hustle, Hustle, Hustle\n5. Have a great team that compliment your strengths ad weaknesses.\n\nEdit: Some redditors don\u2019t believe this, so search for\n\u201cForbes Centroamerica Abril 2022\u201d 30 promesas de los negocios, you will see my face on the cover.\n\nNew edit:\nI will start providing proof of my story on my profile so all of you skeptics can believe, this isn\u2019t for me! It\u2019s for you!!! Human confidence and trust has brought humanity to great lengths, imagine that closed mentality was the same that kept cavemen from believing that human made fire wasn\u2019t sorcery.\n\nI hope you enjoyed my story!!!",

      "title": "Supplier from Alibaba sent me samples with better quality than our actual products. What should I do?",
      "content": "I've been working with a supplier on Alibaba for over 1 year now. They are a verified factory and we do have Alibaba trade insurance on all orders. I have ordered products worth around $130k over 5 different orders in total from this supplier. On our 4th and 5th orders we recently switched to a new upgraded version of our product. Before we committed to this product we of course ordered product samples according to our specifications. We got the samples and verified them and everything was ok so we placed 2 bulk orders according to these specifications.  We finally recently received the first batch of the new products which has been sent out to a few customers now and I started noticing that the products didn't look as good as our sample products. So I ordered a few products home to myself(I'm working with a 3PL so I haven't touched the products at the warehouse). And I noticed that there is quite a big difference between the sample products we received and the actual product we got. The products have a kind of filling inside them and it seems like the sample products filling is of another material which is better than the product we bought. The weight is the same of the sample products and the actual products but the look and feel are a night and day difference between the samples and the actual products. I think the products we received are according to the order specifications but the samples we received have better material than what we ordered. So we have been tricked by them sending us better samples than what our products were supposed to be. If the samples we would have received had the same quality as the goods we got we would have not ordered these.\n\n\nWhat can we do here? Can we open a dispute for these 2 last orders or are we fucked? The problem I'm guessing is that the products we got ARE according to our specifications but the samples we received which we were told were to our specifications have better quality than our specifications. \n\n\nThe customer feedback has been quite ok on these products, we haven't gotten that many complaints but it is still not up to our standard. We want to have the best product on the market which we currently do not have due to this.\n\n\nHas anyone here been in the same situation?",

China is crazy.\n\n\n\n* China is filled with factories, most of which barely know the end product for which they make parts for. Still they are integral to the manufacturing process and will do a great job if you know how to ask them to.\n\n\n\n* Most factories are dirty, have poor/sub-par working conditions, and are located in rural districts outside the of small cities. \nhttp://imgur.com/8tVTcKS,oILFeZq (making sofas)\nhttp://imgur.com/8tVTcKS,oILFeZq#1 (coating steel frames)\nIt's not the best place for hardcore humanitarian types to visit.\n\n\n\n**FAQ**\n\n* *Should I buy from company X on Alibaba?* Probably not. It's unlikely they are the actual manufacturer. They do not have the product in stock. If you negotiate down they will find a manufacturer to lessen the quality to retain their margin. Believe it or not, factories can be very loyal, so expect a battle if you want to dump your supplier and go straight to the mfg later on. \n\n* *Should I hire a sourcing company?* If you just need one part and are not really concerned about developing more business in China, go for it. Overall, I'm not too fond of these companies. They tend to rest on the fact you don't know what you're doing. I've met sourcing experts who have never left the comforts of their major city. \n\n* *OK, so how do I source a product then?* While there isn't a silver-bullet, find someone you trust. Build a relationship over small business. Make it mutually beneficial for your company to grow. There are certainly some very motivated individuals out there.\n\n* *How do I actually import my product?* Find a freight forwarding company, preferably one that has offices near both ports. They will arrange for trucking to port, ocean freight, customs brokerage, documentation, etc. Have multiple forwarders give you line item quotes to ensure you don't get ripped off. Realistically importing a 20' container into the US will be about $2.5k-$4k (+ any import duty). \n\n",

      "content": "I honestly don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I\u2019ve spent years chasing big dreams, pouring everything I had\u2014money, energy, and hope\u2014into chasing success and working towards my goals and dreams. And now I\u2019m sitting here with 8 million pesos (about $141,000) in debt, questioning everything about myself. Why do I dream so big? Why do I keep thinking I can make it? Why can\u2019t I stop?\n\nIt all started in 2019 when I opened my first physical store. I started small, renting an exhibit space to test the market, and to my surprise, it worked. I was making 50,000 pesos (around $880) a month in profit(I was selling women and kids clothing imported from China). That little success felt like validation. I thought, \u201cThis is it!\u201d So, I went all in. I took out a 1 million peso loan (about $17,650) to open a full-scale store. Renovations, stocks\u2014it all felt like the right move.\n\nAnd then COVID hit. Everything shut down, and I was forced to try online. Since I had loans to pay, I had no choice. To my surprise, the online store took off. To think that people were stuck at home, who would buy clothes for going out at a time like this. But! It was became wildly profitable\u2014more than I could have imagined. In December 2020, I hit my biggest milestone: 400,000 pesos (around $7,060) in sales in just 24 hours. I thought I had finally made it. I believed it would always be like this, that this is just the beginning and it will only get better from here.\n\nSo, I doubled down. I secured another loan to increase stock, believing that the more I had, the more I\u2019d sell(this time I was only focusing on children\u2019s clothing and shoes since that is what sold out fast). I was so optimistic, so confident. But 2021 was different. Sales slowed, and I wasn\u2019t paying attention to the numbers. I wasn\u2019t tracking my profit margins or operational costs properly. I just kept pushing forward, thinking I could turn things around if I spent more on ads. I was wrong.\n\nThe debt kept piling up. I had to shut the business down, but my family stepped in. They believed in me, and honestly, I felt like I couldn\u2019t stop. They supported me financially, encouraged me to start again. So, I took out another loan, believing that this time would be different. But it wasn\u2019t. I launched new products, and they didn\u2019t work. I shut down again. And then, because I couldn\u2019t give up, I tried again. And again. And again.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2023, my brand generated 29 million pesos (about $512,000) in sales. I spent an estimated 8 million pesos (about $141,000) on ads alone. I was able to grow my social media presence to 227k followers on facebook and 11k on instagram. I had local celebrities and influencers reaching out to me for collaboration during those times. Yet, somehow, here I am, with nothing to show for it but overwhelming debt and a heart full of regret. I have no idea where the money went. Operational costs were through the roof. At one point, I rented a warehouse for 50,000 pesos ($880) a month. I hired more employees and raised their salaries significantly because I truly believed that the success I had in December 2020 would continue forever.\n\nIt didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve shut the business down for good now. This year, I tried affiliate marketing(US based). My first month was profitable\u2014I made 60,000 pesos ($1,060). I thought, maybe this is it. Maybe I\u2019ve finally found something that works. But again, it fell apart. I ended up adding another 250,000 pesos ($4,400) to my debt(through facebook ads). Then I wrote and launched an ebook, pouring everything into it. Ads, campaigns, promotions\u2014it added another 250,000 pesos to my debt. I really thought, maybe I went through everything for this moment. I was sharing something I believed in deeply\u2014the secret supplier, the supplier of all suppliers. Profit was, of course, the first priority, but this time it felt different. I wanted to become successful while helping others achieve their success too.\n\nBut in the end, once again, it wasn\u2019t. It failed just like the rest, and the heartbreak was unbearable. I had poured my hope, my energy, and my belief into this, thinking it was finally my moment. Instead, it became another painful reminder of how far I\u2019d fallen.\n\nEvery failure has led me deeper into depression. It\u2019s heavy. So heavy. Earlier this year I took so many courses and read books on mindset. And when I tried new things, I also did it with a new mindset. And now, I\u2019m so scared to go back to the person I was before. During all those times when I was chasing success I was miserable. Stuck on survival mode that it affected how I was as a person, mom, wife, daughter and friend. At some point I\u2019m proud of the person I am now, because if I was still who I was these past years I would seriously be contemplating ending my life. And the worst part? My parents. They\u2019ve stepped in so many times, covering loans, supporting me, believing in me. They shouldn\u2019t have to. They\u2019re at an age where they should be resting, enjoying life, not worrying about their daughter\u2019s financial mess. I feel like I\u2019ve failed them spectacularly\u2014over and over again. I was supposed to retire them early, to give back after all they\u2019ve given me. Instead, I\u2019ve only added to their stress.\n\nI keep asking myself, why do I dream so big? Why can\u2019t I just accept a normal life, a stable life? Why can\u2019t I stop chasing this idea that I\u2019m meant for more? I feel like I\u2019ve been stuck in this cycle for years\u2014dreaming, failing, trying again. And now, I\u2019m at the point where I don\u2019t even know who I am without those dreams. I\u2019m tired. I feel defeated. I don\u2019t know how to move forward, but I know I can\u2019t keep going like this.\n\nTo anyone reading this: How do you let go of your dreams and accept that, no matter how deeply you knew in your heart you were meant for greatness, you\u2019re not? I\u2019m 31 years old.\n\nEDIT: \n\nI want to thank everyone who took the time and effort to comment on my post. Your empathy, insights, and advice have been incredibly valuable, and I truly appreciate the kindness and support you\u2019ve shown.\n\nFor context, I\u2019ve taken multiple courses on Facebook ads and marketing, which helped me grow my following and achieve those sales figures. My first business was actually profitable in terms of ad cost versus revenue. However, I rushed things and made decisions that weren\u2019t realistic. Looking back, if I had taken it slow, avoided loans, and been content with making 100k-300k pesos (roughly $1,800-$5,400) a day, the business might still be alive today. Unfortunately, I wanted more\u2014so I took loans, got a warehouse, and hired more employees. When sales slowed down, the loan payments piled up, and I eventually had to shut it all down last year, in 2023.\n\nThis year, I tried affiliate marketing through ClickBank (after taking another course). It was profitable at first, but like before, it eventually wasn\u2019t sustainable. I only tried two products and one MRR (Master Resell Rights) product, and while I generated significant revenue, it still wasn\u2019t enough to turn a profit overall.\n\nLastly, despite wanting to \u201cgatekeep\u201d my supplier (their value lies in being a direct Chinese platform for factories and manufacturers\u2014most sellers on Alibaba and AliExpress are just middlemen and their supplier is this supplier), my sister encouraged me to write an ebook about it since I no longer plan to sell physical products. The goal was to help others while also helping myself.\n\nMoving forward, I\u2019ve decided to focus on freelancing or virtual assistance to gain stability and work toward reducing my debt rather than adding more to it.\n\nI also want to add how grateful I am to have heard from strangers this time. It\u2019s given me a different perspective\u2014a view I couldn\u2019t see on my own.",

      "content": "Hey Reddit,  \nI am 30 years old and educated with a Business degree. After years I landed a job in one of the leading financial groups in Asia. It is great but I felt dull. Lacking of excitements, perhaps its too easy, in some aspects so ..\n\nI made a leap that some might call crazy\u2014I left my $230k job in finance to start my own sourcing company in China. It's been a whirlwind of emotions, but oddly, it feels good.   \nIn finance, my days were predictable. I had set tasks, clear goals, and a pretty good idea of what my paycheck would look like at the end of the year. It was comfortable, but somewhere along the line, it started to feel a bit too... scripted. I craved something more, something that felt like my own.  \nTransitioning to running my own business was like stepping into a different world. Suddenly, there were no clear-cut tasks at the start of each day, no guaranteed paycheck waiting for me. The uncertainty was daunting. Every decision felt like a gamble. Would this supplier be reliable? Can I ensure the quality of the products? How do I manage logistics, warehousing, and especially the nuances of communication and customization with Chinese factories?   \nBut here's the thing\u2014despite the sleepless nights and the steep learning curve, there's a part of this journey that's incredibly fulfilling. For every challenge, there's a victory. For every setback, a lesson learned. The freedom to steer my own ship, to build something from the ground up, has brought a sense of accomplishment I never found in my previous job.  \nI've come to realize that the unpredictability is not a bug; it's a feature. It's what keeps me on my toes, pushes me to innovate, and forces me to grow. And while the path of a business owner is fraught with challenges  \nHere's to the weirdly good feeling of embracing the unknown.  \n",

      "content": "I cannot find a subreddit with over 1000 folks about sourcing.\n\nBut well, in case there isn't one, I'll list a few questions I got in mind, maybe someone will know the answer.\n\n1. I'm looking for more of a private agent than an own way to get to suppliers. A person that can hook me up with both drop for testing and private label for scaling. Where do I even start looking for one? I'm not really keen on looking for anyone on Reddit for that cuz \"my friend we're the best I provide for you cheap price fast shipping\" is not convincing to me. I know damn well a private agent will promise me a candy land, but I've had a 2 or 3 - one found on Reddit who turned out terrible despite promising whatnot. A person lurking for a client in every Reddit post doesn't seem to be reliable in the first place, but well, correct me if I'm wrong. \n2. Is there any other way than to simply start working with someone to determine credibility of that agent? \n3. Is it better to approach agents in Chinese than English? I've translated a few stores in the past few months and handled multilingual customer support, so I'm pretty used to using chat GPT for talking in other languages - and since the language barrier seems to be a problem quite often, I would be fine talking in Chinese, I think\n4. Will a good private agent won't even talk to me, if I don't have a certain MOQ? I know private agent is usually a next step, rather than getting one when the store is not even up - but when you want to sell products almost no one sells, or a variation of it that no one sells - you need to source it with ways out of reach for most people. So a product that's not available on Ali, or CJ, or wherever. I don't want to be the 12th guy selling the same neck massager, got dang it\n5. Are agencies better than private agents? I know they're more expensive, but what about performance?\n6. How did you find your agent, and how is it going? Tell me your story mate! ",

Also they are not straight and aligned as per the approved samples. The supplier is trying to argue a little (overall they do seem to take blame), by saying they sent photos prior to shipping. The photos you could not really gauge the height of the logo relative to the product, my assumption is that all logos would be as per the 5 x samples i got, why would they change??  \n\n\nWhat options do I have here? This supplier is the only supplier I know that makes this product the way I like it, so I do not want our relationship to sour over this. The order does have trade assurance, but a refund and then remanufacturing all of these items seems like a huge delay, we wanted to launch this month and this has stuffed us....\n\nAny ideas?",

      "title": "AI Will Make You Extremely Rich or Kill Your Business in 2024",
      "content": "**Preface:** I'm a solo-founder in the AI space and previously worked as an ML scientist; the new advancements in AI that I'm seeing are going to impact everyone here. It doesn't matter if you're just starting out, or a bootstrapped brick and mortar founder, or even a VC backed hard tech founder. Last year was when the seeds were laid, and this is the year we'll see them bloom. There will be an onslaught of advancements that take place that are borderline inconceivable due to the nature of exponential progress. This will change every single vertical.\n\nI'm making this post because I think AI execution strategy will make or break businesses. Dramatically. Over **$50B** was put into AI startups in 2023 alone. This figure excludes the hundreds of billions poured into AI from enterprises. So, let's follow the money:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1) AI enterprise software.**\n\nThere's a lot to unpack here and this is what I\u2019m currently working on. AI enterprise software will encompass everything from hyper personalized email outbound to AI cold calls to AI that A/B tests ads on synthetic data to vertical specific software. The impact of the former is relatively self explanatory, so I'll focus on the latter. To illustrate vertical specific AI software, I'll use a simple example in the legal space. Lawyers typically have to comb through thousands of pages of documents. Now, using an LLM + a VDB, an AI can instantly answer all of those questions while surfacing the source and highlighting the specific answer in the contract/document. There are dozens of AI startups for this use case alone. This saves lawyers an immense amount of time and allows them to move faster. Firms that adopt this have a fundamental advantage over law firms that don't adopt this. This was 2023 technology. I'm seeing vertical AI software getting built by my friends in areas from construction, to real estate, to even niche areas like chimney manufacturing. This will exist everywhere. Now, this can be extrapolated much further to be applicable to systems that can do reports and even browse the Internet. This brings me to my next point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2) AI information aggregation and spread.**\n\nMy gut tells me that this will have a crescendo moment in the future with hardware advancements (*Rabbit, Tab, etc.*). You won't have to google things because it will be surfaced to you. It's predictive in nature. The people who can get information the fastest will grow their business the fastest. This part is semi-speculative, but due to the nature of LLMs being so expensive to train, I have a strong feeling that large institutions will have access to the *\\*fastest\\** and *\\*best\\** models that can do this quicker than you and I can. This is why it's important to stay on top.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3) AI content generation**\n\nThis is relevant to running advertisements and any digital marketing aspect of your business. If you can rapidly make content faster than your competitors to put in social media, you will outpace your competitors rapidly. I think most folks are familiar with MidJourney, Stable diffusion, etc. but don't know how to use it. You can generate consistent models for a clothing brand or generate images of a product that you would normally need to hire a professional photographer to take. There's also elevenlabs which is relatively easy to use and can be used to make an MP3 clip as a narration for an ad; this is something I've already done. I'm also still shocked by how many people are unfamiliar with tools like [**Pika**](https://pika.art) which can do video generation. You could imagine companies having ***fleets of digital influencers*** that they control or conjuring up the perfect ad for a specific demographic using a combination of all of the aforementioned tools.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In summary,** if you feel like I'm being hyperbolic or propagating science fiction fantasies, you're likely already behind. I truly recommend that everyone stays up to date on these advancements as much as possible. If your competitor comes across an AI tool that can increase their ROAS by 5x they can crush you. If your competitor uses a tool that increases the rate at which they receive and aggregate information by 200% (modest estimate) they will crush you. If your competitors have a tool that can reduce their employee size, then they will use it. They'll fire their employees to cut costs and reinvest the money back into their business. It will compound to the point where you're outpaced, and this isn't a level of innovation we've seen since the birth of the industrial revolution. Your customers can get stolen overnight, or you can steal your competition\u2019s customers overnight.\n\n**TL;DR:** This is an opportunity for entrepreneurs to scale faster than they could have possibly imagined, but this also comes with the potential for your company to be obliterated. We've never seen advancements that can have this drastic of an impact this quickly. Adoption will happen fast, and first movers will have a disproportionate and compounding advantage. Watch guides, meet with startups, follow the news, and get rich.",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m part of a Chinese manufacturing company that has been exporting indoor playground equipment globally for over 15 years \u2014 mainly to small business clients like family entertainment centers, kids' caf\u00e9s, and franchises.\n\nJust last week, **the U.S. tariff on our category jumped from 34% to 104%**. One of our American customers said, *\u201cThere\u2019s no way I can make a profit now.\u201d*\n\nI'm not here to promote or sell anything \u2014 I\u2019m genuinely looking to understand how **U.S. small businesses are adapting to these new tariffs**, especially when:\n\n* The products are not produced locally in the U.S. at all.\n* Alternatives (e.g., India, Vietnam) don\u2019t offer the same quality or safety certifications.\n* Buyers still need these products for planned launches or seasonal openings.\n\nA few questions I\u2019d love your insight on:\n\n* If you were affected by similar tariffs, how did you manage or negotiate around them?\n* Have you worked with suppliers that ship through third countries to reduce the duty impact?\n* How do you communicate such a big cost jump to your customers?\n\nI truly believe this issue affects both sides of the supply chain. I\u2019m here to listen and learn from your experiences \u2014 thanks in advance.",

As someone who\u2019s been dropshipping from Alibaba/AliExpress to the US for a while, I\u2019m freaking out a bit. Did some quick math: a $10 product now costs $22.50 landed before shipping. Margins are toast unless I jack up prices or find new suppliers.  \n\nAnyone else feeling this? Are you sticking with China and raising prices, or jumping ship to Vietnam/India/US suppliers? I\u2019m worried customers won\u2019t bite if I double my prices, but eating these costs isn\u2019t an option either. Plus, if they kill the $800 de minimis loophole, even small orders are screwed.  \n\nWhat\u2019s your game plan? Is this the end of cheap Chinese dropshipping, or am I overreacting?

(not all products of course but many)\n\nFor example, in my mind I was going to purchase a product wholesale from a company I know and love and is in the USA thinking their products are made in the USA too... But then I learn they're just buying their products from china on Alibaba just like everyone else! Why the hell did I think sustainable and \"made in USA\" were synonymous? \n\nI guess now I just feel bad. for 1 because I'm now learning this is the world we live in when it comes to retail but also 2 because where does that leave me? Why wouldn't I skip the middle man (wholesaler) when I can just go straight to the source (china/Alibaba/whatever) for a fraction of the cost? But seeing as I'm a \"sustainable\" retailer I guess now I feel like a fraud.\n\nI'm new to this world... so if you have advice on how to source products and suppliers that focuses on sustainability and ethical practices I would love to hear it. \n\nNote: it's okay commentators you can rip me a new one. also note\\* obviously I'm not sourcing everything from china. Many products are niche and are being sourced from small businesses in USA... but not all.",

There are already enough product clones floating around the internet. Rather, I'd love to help people understand which factories to use versus just blasting out e-mails on Alibaba, trying to intelligently decide which  factories to visit, walking into a trade show blind or relying solely on connections with your existing factories.\n\n**It  is still in a super rough beta state. I've only invested a handful of  hours and am interested in understanding if this tool is actually  helpful and what direction I should take it in.

      "title": "How I've been making over 10k / mon. since 20 (25 now)",
      "content": "Want to give some value, in particular for the younger guys, as I know how the online entrepreneur space is these days. SMMA, dropshipping, crypto, lambos, Miami, Dubai, I know what it's like to see that stuff all over the internet. All of these gurus, infoproduct guys, etc. etc. \n\nMy average month is about 20k-30k now, I do real life business, I didn't just hit it once, It has been consistent. I had a clothing brand agency, well still do, and my biggest month was about 25k Rev, but the majority of money I've made was in sales. I've tried dropshipping, SMMA, Crypto, all of it. My first sales job was as a door to door canvasser, setting free roof inspections for a roofing company at 19. I didn't want to do it, I had too much pride, always told myself I'd run my own company, be a millionaire before everyone else. I was the only kid my age at the time into self improvement, going to seminars, Tony Robbins, Gary Vee, etc. but I didn't have the vehicle to make my first money yet. I eventually lost my job, car got totaled, I was late on rent, no source of transportation and this offer came up. Long story short, I did it and made my rent that first week, which was $1,000 at the time (2018). The sales guys that were closing all made over $100k. Before you make a million, you need to surpass six figures. \n\nNow I'll get deeper into the specific industry I'm in but I want to highlight D2D, and sales in general as it relates to entrepreneurs. The entrepreneurial spirit is something some of us are born and gifted with. It is only a matter of time before you find the vehicle to express that. Entrepreneurship is a sport to a degree, but it's a mental one, not physical. There are skillsets involved, like in sports. A fighter will train to enhance his skills, speed, power, cardio, different fighting styles, boxing, BJJ, etc. I say this because as an entrepreneur, your ability to succeed depends on your strengths and weaknesses, and building your strengths is only a matter of putting in reps. No course or PDF will put reps in for you. You need to train and persistently put in those reps to enhance those skills that translate into desired outcomes and results. This is where sales comes in. D2D is unlimited entrepreneurship training, and the best part is you get paid to learn. If you started a business from scratch right now, with no experience, you'd need to sell one of two things, a product, or a service. Now in the creation of that product or service, there are skillsets involved in doing so, you have to build those, and if you want to succeed at them, you have to get good as well. In sales, its one primary skill, you're selling someone else's product or service, so you don't have to worry about the fulfillment or management of that business. Sales and marketing drive revenue simply speaking. If you can sell and market, you can profit. Where many young people, myself included, go wrong, is they hear about these business models that these guys teach, and try to manage a business that they know nothing about. They tell you how they made $10k, $100k per month. And give you a blue print of what they're doing, but you didn't put in the reps they did. If LeBron put out a course on how to shoot better, I imagine there's some value in that, but you aren't putting in LeBrons work, and with his natural gifts, so you're not going to become him. Lock in on whats in front of you and progress by mastering one thing, then learning the next skillset you know you'll need to learn on the trajectory to become a master CEO. This is the way, not chasing online trends. FB ads changes, Tik Tik changes, Instagram changes, markets get saturated. Build you. \n\nNow what is the industry I'm in? Exterior home restoration. What is that? Well basically we complete work on homes from storm damage, hail, winds, tornadoes, hurricanes, etc. and insurance pays for the work. Every home owner has insurance, and these companies pay for repairs to be completed. Like an auto body shop, if you crash a car, or got hail damage, the company pays the shop, shop does the work, and boom everyone's happy. I started setting leads, went on to closing deals, then later started project managing. Roofing was the bread and butter, but I've made the most of money so far doing niche high end windows that get damaged by hail. These windows are 5x the cost of a roof, and most contractors have no clue how to deal with the claims and install. I have an LLC and subcontracted by the contractors to generate deals. I close the deals, they complete the work. This is my business, and it works well. I get a $5k avg. per deal, and I sell a lot. If you're interested in learning more about this specific industry fire away questions or DM me, I'm more than happy to help. ",

      "title": "What I learnt from sourcing e-commerce products from China.",
      "content": "DISCLAIMER: The intention of this to increase cautiousness and practice best practices between the entrepreneurs that are importing from China. \n\nSo I have been running an e-commerce store for a very long time, not a drop-shipping particularly but we would order the products in bulk to the country and then ship from there (For faster shipping).I wanted to do drop-shipping but then it halted back in 2019, right after the COVID and ePacket was banned >!(ePacket is a shipping agreement between US and China to reduce shipping times, it uses passenger planes to carry the parcel, hence faster shipping)!<.\n\nAnyway getting back to the point, We were selling jewellery in the United States, firstly we used to just order from Aliexpress (a bunch of 500 every week) to our warehouse, do the quality check and then we would ship it from there. However the price per item was $7.80 and it was selling for $25.99 with a good profit margin.\n\nWe decided to scale that store (I shared the scaling strategy in a different blog post) by going to a supplier and ordering 10K since Q4 was coming up and we were trying to scale up, the item was selling like a hot dog. We posted a few Request For Quotation on Alibaba and got some quotations and here are my learnings.\n\n* **You will get the same product for less.**\n\nThe item we were getting for $7.80 was available for as low as $4.00 if we ordered in bulk, and as high as $10, so it varies. If you order $10K units then it will be available for $2.00. The more volume you ask for the lesser the cost will be - I mean it's normal, but the cost can go very low. I mean compare $7.80 to $2.00\n\n* **You will have to do your own quality check.**\n\nAlibaba is not like Amazon where they do the quality check for you, you will have to do your quality check before you ship the items to your customers. We ordered 10K and got around 300 defective items from the supply. (either they were broken, or of a bad quality). And then you have to send them to the supplier, the supplier will usually ask you to send the items back but it's not worth the time. So make sure that you order at least 10% more of what you need.\n\n* **Plan your shipments accordingly and choose the correct method**\n\nUnrelated to the store, we saw a great kitchen product that we thought could do really good in the American market, but the problem? It was 1.2Kgs. It was a really large item made out of stainless steel. We wanted it faster but AIR CARGO was expensive (it was charging $2000) as we did not have time since Q4 was already around the corner, however the affordable option was ship containers but the transit time was 1 month. So make sure if you plan to order large items, do it beforehand and make sure you choose the right shipping service to save costs.\n\n* **Trust your negotiation skills.**\n\nYou got to trust your negotiations skills and don't be shy when negotiating with your suppliers, we got down the per product cost from $6 to $4.80. While it may not seem a lot but it saved around $3500 per order. So negotiation works! I mean just like any other business.\n\n* **Never ditch a supplier too early.**\n\nIf you find a better price somewhere then don't move your orders at once, we got a supplier that was giving the exact same product for almost 20% less, and ordered 500 units from them. Most of the units were defective, so always maintain multiple suppliers until you do the quality check of both of the suppliers.\n\n* **Have multiple modes of communication**\n\nIf you're using Alibaba chat to communicate with your suppliers then make sure you have their emails and WhatsApp, WeChat or anything they use because they will go offline without prior notice.\n\n* **You will get free FedEX/UPS shipping**\n\nDon't hesitate to ask for premium shipping if you maintain a good relationship, the supplier we had used to send the items using ePacket which used to take 10-14 days, talked to the supplier and he offered a premium FedEX shipping for large orders which delivered the order in 4-5 days max (to California)\n\n* **Always use AliBaba Payment Gateway**\n\nNever use PayPal, or WeChat or anything else to send the funds, it's just not worth the hassle. Even though you have the escrow services at place. I would just avoid PayPal or anything and just go with Alibaba's gateway. It is seamless and has a great grievance redressal system.\n\n* **Product Sourcing Agents are great but be careful**\n\nThere are a lot of product sourcing agents are great, they will get in touch directly with the manufacturer for you and can get any type of customisation done for you and can get you better prices. But be careful and use a better sourcing agent.\n\nI guess that was it. I will edit this post if I find more points to address.",

I even made a detailed post about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/k9rp3k/tips_and_tricks_for_finding_the_right_supplier_on/).\n\nHowever, the prices keep going up, not to mention the cost of shipping which had almost doubled in price in less than a year.\n\nOrdering from China has become too difficult, so I am looking for a white-label manufacturer of women's sportswear (leggings primarily) in Europe.\n\nI am not interested in ordering clothes from stock but in making garments from scratch following my design ideas.\n\nIf anyone can point me in the right direction, I would be most thankful.\n\nOtherwise, I am also interested in knowing how you guys are battling the increase in prices in China?\n\nThanks",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m currently a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University. Lately, I\u2019ve become really curious about international trade, especially how small businesses in the US manage to import products from China.\n\n\n\nA bit of context: many of my friends from high school and college (some still in China) are running \u201cinternational trade\u201d businesses. To be honest, it\u2019s quite surprising to me, because most of them don\u2019t speak much English or have any background in manufacturing or supply chains. From what I\u2019ve gathered, they mostly find local Chinese products and resell them via platforms like Alibaba and Amazon.\n\n\n\nThis got me thinking\u2014how do small businesses based in the US (who are far from the source) handle product quality, customs, and communication with suppliers? Big companies have teams, lawyers, and huge purchase volumes to leverage, but small businesses seem to face more uncertainty and risk in cross-border trade.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re a small business owner or have experience sourcing from China, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. How do you make it work? Do you use sourcing agents? How do you manage quality control remotely? Any insights or stories would be greatly appreciated.",

I really appreciated the replies \u2014 super helpful!\n\nTo follow up: most of the products I\u2019m working with are under $5, which makes it tricky to justify custom packaging. Based on your advice, I started looking into OEM options and 3PL services for repackaging. Some suppliers are open to private label, but the MOQ is still a bit high for testing.\n\nIf you're selling <$10 products:\n- How do you balance packaging cost with perceived value?\n- Have you found any budget-friendly packaging strategies that still look professional?\n- Do you repack in-house or use a 3PL?\n\nThanks again \u2014 this sub has been incredibly helpful. Just trying to avoid rookie mistakes and find a sustainable workflow!",

You can answer questions like:\n\n* **Who makes Bass Pro Shop's 4 Burner Gas Griddle?** Answer: NINGBO HUIGE OUTDOOR PRODUCTS\n* I thinking of buying barbells from a company I found on Alibaba called Nantong Leeton Fitness Co., the #1 ranking company on Alibaba for the term \"barbell\". **Is Nantong Leeton Fitness Co. the right supplier?** Answer: No. They are a big company but primarily sell resistance bands & foam rollers. They are likely outsourcing their heavy metal work creating a more costly product for you and you're more likely to have quality issues as well.\n* **Who are the top companies & suppliers who import/export under HS Code 42.02.92 -- trunks & suitcases?**\n* **Who are the top companies & suppliers who import/export under HS Code 42.02.92 out of Indonesia?**\n\nI want to thank the 600+ redditors from r/Entrepreneur who gave feedback on ImportYeti.

I added every major(but still possible) request that was mentioned during our closed beta test including hs-code/hts-code functionality(I'm really interested in feedback on this in particular), various search filters, address search (so you can try to find companies importing under different names), did multiple passes de-duping the company names (still needs some work, but a lot better), completely rewrote our search algorithm and fixed 100+ bugs & usability issues.\n\n**Even though I'm allowing puiblc access this time, I'd still love any and all feedback (love or hate)... no matter how brutal : ) I only want to create things that people really love.

I know many of our products are imported from China however the quality standards for many products imported by the United States make them more desirable. I\u2019m currently sourcing materials from Costco and BJ\u2019s does anyone have any recommendations on cheaper sources?

      "content": "I started a tutoring service last year which is doing decently well but not enough. So I decided to start a product based business. I want to curate gift boxes/hampers with 5-7 small and big items serving a theme.. my dilemma is whether to source from China (like alibaba-low cost low selling price)  or locally (from faire-high cost premium prices). The reason I\u2019m conflicted is because my sister recommended i just post pictures from the Internet of the products i want to sell to do some market research first and then decide where to source from however my business is not of the products but the curating, personalizing, packaging etc. so I\u2019ll have to put in money upfront, get samples of some items, curate them and then post it online and see what happens. \n\nI guess this is also a brand identify crisis where I cant decide what my brand should be and what I represent, cheap and affordable or premium, ethical and local.. \n\nPlease help me decide!!

      "title": "I closed 200+ freelance deals with this script",
      "content": "I always thought I sucked at sales.\n\nGot my first job as a telemarketer when I was 16, and I quit 6 hours into my first shift.\n\nIt was emotionally exhausting and I honestly felt disgusted.\n\nThis experience scarred me for years and held me back when I started building my freelancing business 8 years later.\n\nThen I joined an absurdly expensive mastermind ($7500 / 3 months) where they shared the initial version of the script I'm about to share with you.\n\nAnd it flipped my entire mindset about what it takes to sell on its head.\n\nInstead of being salesy, they told me to act like a doctor. Diagnose and then confidently present the cure.\n\nAfter I started doing this, I closed 200+ deals for my freelancing business. From big tech companies all the way down to small mom-and-pop online stores.\n\nHere's the script that changed everything for me:\n\n# The mindset\n\nBefore we get into the \"what to say,\" we need to fix the \"how to think.\" This is 90% of the battle.\n\n* Your job isn't to push a product; it's to diagnose a problem. You should be listening, asking intelligent questions, and determining **if you're even the right person to help them**. If a doctor listened to your symptoms for 30 seconds and immediately tried to sell you on a specific surgery, you'd run. Don't be that person.\n* In the first half of the call, the client should be doing 80% of the talking. If you're talking more than them, you're pitching, not discovering. You're losing.\n* You don't\u00a0need\u00a0this client. You are evaluating\u00a0them\u00a0just as much as they are evaluating you. Think of it like a first date. You're not trying to force a second date from the moment you sit down. You're genuinely trying to see if there's a connection and if you're compatible for a long-term relationship.\n* Do not read this word-for-word. Reading makes you sound like a robot and breaks all trust.\n\n# Preparation\n\nGood prep is going to be the source of your confidence. Knowing your questions and your offer ahead of time frees up your mental energy to actively listen.\n\n1. Go through the steps below and write down 3-5 specific questions for each section.\n2. **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Prepare 1-3 clear service packages with prices**. Even if you won\u2019t be able to pitch a productized service, this will help you quickly and without hesitation answer ANY questions regarding your pricing (e.g. \"I've done similar projects for around $4.000). This makes you look like someone who\u2019s been doing this for years, is a professional and even **allows you to close the deal on the call** instead of letting the momentum die with a \"let me get back to you with a proposal.\"\n\n**The biggest mistake most people make is to NOT talk about pricing.**\n\nTalking about pricing massively speeds up the sales process, because prospects can either accept your offer immediately, decline it, or try a delay tactic.\n\nIf they accept - then great!\n\nIf they decline or delay, you can ASK them why, and you\u2019ll find out a lot about the objections they have about working with you.\n\n# The warm-up\n\nSpending 2-3 minutes on small talk shows you\u2019re a relaxed, normal person, which helps the prospect relax, too.\n\n* What to Say:\n   * \u201cI see you're based in Austin. I've heard great things about the food scene there.\u201d\n   * \u201cI have to mention this, you picked the best Zoom background.\u201d\n   * \u201cGlad we could connect before the weekend. Any exciting plans?\u201d\n\nThen, transition and set the frame. This is crucial for taking control.\n\n* \"Awesome! Well, I\u2019m excited to chat. Should we dive right in?\"\u00a0(Wait for \"yes\")\n* \"Great. So the way I usually run these calls is I'll start by asking a few questions to get a really clear picture of your business and what you're looking for. If it sounds like I can definitely help, I\u2019ll explain how I work. Sound good?\"\n\n# Discovery\n\nThis is your \"doctor\" phase. Start broad and then go deep.\n\n* **If they reached out to you:**\u00a0\"So, to start, I\u2019d love to hear what prompted you to book this call today? What\u2019s going on in your business?\"\n* **If you reached out to them:**\u00a0\"When I reached out, something in my message must have clicked. What was it that made you decide to take this call?\"\n\nNow, shut up and listen. Take notes. After their initial answer, dig deeper with your prepared, service-specific questions.\n\n* **Pro-Tip:**\u00a0If they give short, unhelpful answers, use this:\u00a0**\"Could you tell me a bit more about that?\"**\n\n# Their experience\n\nAre you talking to a seasoned pro or a total beginner? The answer dictates how you'll pitch later on and what kind of questions to ask.\n\n* \"Have you tackled this issue before? What worked or didn\u2019t work?\"\n* \"Have you worked with another freelancer or agency on this? What was that like?\"\n\nThis tells you what they value, what they hate, and what landmines to avoid. If they say their last designer was a \"terrible communicator,\" you know to highlight your communication process in your pitch.\n\nOn the other hand if they tell you they've had 20 freelancers on this and that they all sucked, you should probably run away.\n\n# Defining success\n\nThis is where you move from their\u00a0problems\u00a0to their\u00a0aspirations.\n\n* \"Okay, let's fast forward 6 months. If we were to work together on this, what would need to have happened for you to feel like this was a huge success?\"\n* \"What would achieving \\[their goal\\] actually do for your business? Why is this a priority right now?\"\n\nWhen they answer this, they are literally selling\u00a0themselves\u00a0on the value of your service. Write down their exact words.\n\n# Uncovering roadblocks\n\nWhy their problem still exists. This is the bridge to your pitch.\n\n* \"So you\u2019re looking to achieve \\[their goal\\]. What\u2019s held you back from getting this done on your own so far?\"\n* \"Why do you think you haven't found the right person to help with this yet?\"\n\nTheir answer here is pure gold. It gives you the exact angle for your pitch.\n\n* If they say \"I don't have the time,\" your solution is about a hands-off, \"done-for-you\" process.\n* If they say \"I don't have the expertise,\" your solution is about your deep knowledge and strategic guidance.\n\n# The pitch\n\nSee how late this comes? You should only pitch after you fully understand their situation.\n\n* **Ask for permission:** \"Okay, based on everything you've told me, I have a very clear picture of the situation. I'm confident I can help you achieve \\[Their Goal\\]. Would it be okay if I walk you through how I'd approach it?\"\n* **Frame it:**\u00a0\"Great. So I specialize in helping \\[businesses like them\\] to \\[achieve the exact goal they just told you\\].\"\n* **Show proof:**\u00a0\"For example, last quarter I worked with \\[Similar Client\\], who was struggling with \\[Similar Problem\\]. We implemented this process and they were able to \\[Achieve Result\\].\"\n* **Explain the process:**\u00a0Walk them through the steps.\n   * \"First, we\u2019d start with a kickoff session to...\"\n   * \"Next, I\u2019ll prepare xyz to...\"\n   * \"Finally, you\u2019ll get...\"\n\n**IMPORTANT:** DO NOT REVEAL YOUR PRICING OR PACKAGES AT THIS POINT! Focus solely on the workflow and deliverables.\n\nAfter you're done, ask them:\n\n*  \"That\u2019s the general overview. What questions do you have about that for me?\"\n\nWhen they run out of process questions, they will almost always ask the big one: \"So... how much does it cost?\" This is the moment you've been waiting for.\n\n* \"The cost for the package I just described is $7,500.\"\n\nState your price clearly and confidently. Then, the most important part:\n\n**BE SILENT.**\n\nDo not justify it. Do not explain it. Do not say \"but we can be flexible.\" The first person who talks, loses. Let them react. Their reaction tells you everything you need to know.\n\n# Handling objections\n\nAn objection is not a \"no.\" It's a request for more information or reassurance. Don't get defensive. You can't handle an objection if you don't know what they're thinking. So your first job is to figure out what they're trying to say.\n\n**\"That's more expensive than I was expecting\"**\n\n* \"I understand. Can I ask what you were budgeting for a project like this?\"\u00a0OR\u00a0\"Could you tell me a bit more about what makes it feel expensive?\"\u00a0(This helps you understand if it's a value problem or a cash flow problem).\n\n**\"I need to think about it.\"**\n\n* \"That\u2019s perfectly fine; most of my best clients take time to think. Just so I can understand, what specific part of it do you need to think about most?\"\n\n**\"Why would I pay this much when I can get someone on Fiverr for $500?\"**\n\n* \"That's a fair question. You're right, there are definitely cheaper options out there, and for simple tasks, they can be great. The question is, are you looking to buy a task, or are you looking to buy a business outcome? A task-doer will do exactly what you say. I see my role as a strategic partner to help you achieve \\[their goal\\]. Which of those is more important to you right now?\"\n\n(I've got more objections and how to handle them in the google docs I'm linking below)\n\n# The close\n\nIf they agree with your price and want to move forward, you're not done yet. You need to handle the final step professionally.\n\n* Immediately explain the next steps.\u00a0\"Great! Here\u2019s what will happen next. I'm going to send over the contract and an invoice for the initial deposit. Once that's handled, I'll send you a link to book our kickoff call.\"\n* Don't just hang up after that! Spend 2-3 minutes returning to small talk. This calms their nerves, eases potential buyer's remorse, and reinforces that you're a human they're building a relationship with, not just a vendor who got their money.\n\n# Extra info\n\nI've put some extra objection handling examples, more info, more examples, etc. into a Google Doc which I'm linking in a comment below, to keep this post on point.  \n  \nThis all takes practice to master so I also created a ChatGPT Monster prompt that will roleplay different levels of clients (easy to hard). I'm also including it at the bottom of the doc.  \n",

      "content": "Hey /r/entrepeneur Cory here from Woodies.   **Thanks for the Gold!**\n\nI just read the post about some guy un-subbing because of all the click-bait, shit-posts, so now that he's gone, I thought I'd contribute really helpful content!\n\nWhile making this list, I cannot believe how many freaking services I use, it's kind of ridiculous, I probably need to cancel a few.  \n\nI've been running Woodies for 5 years now, and my vision has become clear.  I want to make as much money as possible while maintaining complete control of my business.  I have no employees, I have no partners.  I'm on track to *hopefully* do a million in revenue this year.\n\nI'm looking for anything that saves me time.  I'm a graduate of the four-hour workweek school of thought and my goal is to outsource everything I can, and automate everything that allows me to multiply my efforts.  \n\nHere is the full list of apps and SaaS that I use to run Woodies:\n\n[***Shopify***](http://shopify.com):  The alpha dog in the ecommerce space\n\n***Shopify Apps***:\n\n***[Login with Amazon](https://apps.shopify.com/login-with-amazon)***:  60% of traffic comes from mobile but only 20% of checkouts, why?  Because it's hard to enter your info, this allows people to login with their Amazon account, choose their address, choose their payment method and boom they're checked out.  Great app\n\n***[Make an Offer](https://apps.shopify.com/make-an-offer)***:  Exit-intent pop-up that allows customers to submit an offer for a product they wanted, they give their email, I use Zapier to shoot them a discount code and to add their email to Mailchimp\n\n***[ShopiMap](https://apps.shopify.com/shopimap)***:  It puts a pin on every customer and shows what they ordered.  Great for social proof.  [Here's mine for Woodies](https://woodies.com/pages/who-wears-woodies)\n\n***[CovetPics](https://apps.shopify.com/covet-pics)***:  Cool Instagram plug-in that makes a collage from my Instagram account and integrates the photos on each product page\n\n[***Yotpo***](http://yotpo.com):  I was lucky to get them while they cost $30/month  now it costs like $300 a month to collect reviews.  It's a really great app though, it auto-sends review requests and displays them on product pages.  I wish they picked a better name, Yotpo is kinda lame\n\n***[Spently](https://apps.shopify.com/spently)***:  I use them for sending out sweet order confirmation emails. The default ones from Shopify are pretty boring, these are awesome, shout to Nick!\n\n***[Compass.Co](http://compass.co)***:  The best ecommerce analytics I've seen, they integrate with all my sales channels and pull in more information than I knew I had and organize it neatly\n\n[***Amazon:***](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/homepage.html)  My number one sales platform, responsible for over 60% of my sales\n\n***Customer Service***:  This is VERY IMPORTANT.  Luckily, I pay my mom a monthly rate to perform this valuable service.  ([*thanks mom!*](https://woodies.com/pages/contact))  Unfortunately, you can't use her!  You CAN use someone else's mom however, the website [HireMyMom](https://www.hiremymom.com/) (queue all the reddit jokes)  We all know mom's are awesome, they're usually consistent, reliable, and friendly.  For VA's, mom's are #1\n\n[***AmazonFBA***](https://services.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon/benefits.htm):  The service that receives, stores, packs, and ships 100% of my products.  Without this service, I wouldn't be able to travel full-time, I'd need to rent a warehouse, hire workers, and the rest\n\n***[Amazon Affiliates](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/welcome)***:  I sell on Shopify and Amazon, but I understand there are people out there who just LOVE Amazon Prime, so they go to my site, find a product they like, then want to buy it Amazon, I don't blame them, I would prefer free shipping also.  SO on each of my product pages, I include a link to my product listing on Amazon, I use an affiliate link so that I make like 1% of the order.  It adds up to only like $100/month, but it's better than nothing.  ***See an example: [Woodies Zebrawood Sunglasses](https://woodies.com/collections/bamboo-wood-sunglasses/products/zebra-wood-aviator-wrap-sunglasses)*** *warning: affiliate link on next page*\n\nAmazon Apps:\n\n[***FeedbackGenius***](https://www.feedbackgenius.com/):  Sends automatic feedback requests to hundreds of orders per day, reviews are so valuable on Amazon that this app pays for itself many times over\n\n***[HelloProfit](http://helloprofit.com)***:  I started realizing how many different services I use and I went in a cancelled this one, $79 a month just to make the reports section of Amazon look better, not worth it\n\nWebsite:  \n\n[***Cloudflare***](https://www.cloudflare.com):  Supposedly makes my website faster, I have no idea honestly how this works, might be wasting $20/month, can anyone chime in here??  \n\n***[Typeform](http://typeform.com)***:  Awesome way to use forms.  I use them to collect information from giveaways.  \n\n***[Zapier](http://zapier.com)***:  Works well with Typeform to transfer data in between services like Gmail - Typeform - GoogleDocs - Mailchimp - Shopify.  Example, customer buys thing, Shopify tells Gmail, Gmail sends Email with Typeform, Shopify tells Mailchimp, Mailchimp adds to segment, Customer fills out Typeform, Typeform tells Mailchimp to send out Gmail, wait what?  It gets complicated\n\n***[GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com)***:  Probably not the best out there, but whatever it works fine, never had a problem\n\nTask Management:\n\n***[Gmail](http://gmail.com)***: I try to only check it twice a day, and my absolute goal is [Inbox Zero](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/inbox-zero)\n\n*Pro-tip*  [Learn all the Gmail keyboard shortcuts](https://www.shortcutworld.com/en/mac/Gmail.html)  \n\n*Pro-tip 2*  Enable Send+Archive in Gmail Settings and set it up to automatically open your next email\n\n[***Inbox Pause***](http://inboxpause.com/):  Helps me stick to my twice a day 'batching' of emails.  Pauses my email flow after I enable it.  This is to prevent that nasty habit of working on a tough task, then switching to gmail so I can answer 2-3 'easy' emails\n\n***[Trello](http://Trello.com)***:  In my never-ending pursuit of Inbox Zero, I have rules for when I encounter a batch of emails:\n\n* If I can respond within 1-2 minutes, I respond\n\n* If it would take me more than 2 minutes, I create a task on Trello\n\n***Gmail Timer Logs:***  Automatically starts a timer whenever I open a new email\n\n***Chrome Extensions:***\n\n***[LastPASS](http://lastpass.com)***:  Saves all my passwords, auto-login, and form-fills my payment methods. Pro-tip: save info from one CC to use online only and then cut it up, nothing is more frustrating than losing my card at the bar and having to reset 20 different subscriptions\n\n[***Block Site***](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh?hl=en):  The best website blocker I've used.  Simple, works, and enough of a pain to disable that I usually don't bother\n\n[***The Great Suspender***](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg?hl=en):  When I work, I usually have 15-20 tabs open at a time, this suspends the background tabs so the open ones run faster\n\n***[AMZ Seller Browser](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amz-seller-browser/klgpelgeohjghmccooegimcfhanlnngc?hl=en)***:  Let's me easily see Price History and Sales Rank on Amazon to help me keep track of competition\n\n***[Alexa Traffic](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/alexa-traffic-rank/cknebhggccemgcnbidipinkifmmegdel?hl=en)*** + ***[Similarweb](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/similarweb-website-rankin/hoklmmgfnpapgjgcpechhaamimifchmp?hl=en)***:  Helps me quickly assess how much traffic any site gets.  Also a quick way to check page loading speed\n\n***[OpenVid](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/openvid-screen-mic-and-ca/liecbddmkiiihnedobmlmillhodjkdmb)***:  A quick way to record a screencast so you can show a designer exactly what you want fixed and not have to setup a whole screenshare\n\nProduct Development:\n\n***[Alibaba](http://Alibaba.com)***:  Still my first stop when it comes to searching for new products.  Just message suppliers asking them to email you back.  1. This avoids Alibaba's terribly designed messaging system  2.  This filters out suppliers who cannot follow simple instructions\n\n[***Whatsapp***](http://whatsapp.com):  Once you start working with a supplier, get them on whatsapp, Chinese tend to prefer messaging over email and I consider this my most important business relationship, so it's worth it\n\n[***Flexport***](http://flexport.com):  Not sure if they're accepting new members again yet, makes international freight forwarding as easy as ordering pizza\n\n[***Upgraded Images***](http://upgradedimages.com):  Ken at Upgraded Images is my go-to guy for getting great product photography that stands out.  Quick, affordable, and quality stuff\n\n[***SpeedyBarcodes***](https://speedybarcodes.com/):  Where I buy barcodes so I can sell on Amazon\n\nMarketing:\n\n***[Schedugram](http://schedugr.am)***:  Allows me to schedule Instagram posts in advance and have them automatically post (the only tech that does that automatically I believe)\n\n***[Repost](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/repost-for-instagram/id570315854?mt=8)***:  Repost other Instagram photos, usually of people who tag Woodies in a photo\n\n***[Instagram](http://instagram.com)*** and ^^[Snapchat](http://snapchat.com):  Can we all agree that Instagram is king and Snapchat has been demoted to court jester?  Here's my personal Instagram:  [WoodiesCaptain](http://instagram.com/woodiescaptain) and the [Woodies IG](http://instagram.com/woodies), if you're interested\n\n*also good for hitting up your WCW, just sliiiiiide in the DM and see if she'll post a pic*\n\n[***Mailchimp***](http://mailchimp.com):  Been using them for 4 years to send out emails, I send out really simple emails so I could probably downgrade to something else.  I'm also considering [***Klaviyo***](https://www.klaviyo.com/) because it's built specifically for Shopify. \n\nApps:\n\n[TripIt](http://tripit.com):  I travel full-time (don't have a home) so this keeps track of all my itineraries\n\n[***F.lux***](https://justgetflux.com/):  Dims my screen at night to give my eyes a break while I work late *highly recommended*\n\n***[Franz](http://meetfranz.com/)***:  Messaging app for Mac that combines Whatsapp, Messenger, Hangouts, Slack, Skype, and WeChat all in one easy to use client\n\nNot a fan:  StitchLabs, Shipwire, AppSumo is suddenly not my favorite app mostly because I can't figure it out, apps should just WORK or GTFO\n\nWhat apps or SaaS am I missing??\n\nps.  I don't have an app for this but I'm a HUGE fan of saying NO to people.  No, I don't sell wholesale. No, I don't ship internationally. No creates space for you to think clearly about what you really want.  No opens up time to work on truly important work\n\nI'll stick around to answer any questions, you can also PM me, or email Cory@Woodies.com \n\nSee you at the beach!\n\nCory Stout\n\nCaptain, [Woodies](https://woodies.com)",

You will definitely want the suppliers to be:\n\n**Gold suppliers:**\n\nThis is a paid membership from Alibaba for the supplier. They get featured and can put up a lot more items in their catalogue (among other functions).\n\n**Onsite Checked:**\n\nThe onsite operation of the factory has been checked by Alibaba and a third party confirmed its legal existence.\n\n**Assessed suppliers:**\n\nThis is a third-party assessment usually done through a testing company to verify various parts of the company. This includes machinery, staff, engineers, workers, certification, and much more.\n\nAfter you have filtered for this you are down to 8,258 products:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/tv8C48r\n\n**Insider tip:**\n\nNow you filter down to the relevant manufacturing province. Why? Because each province in China is specific for different product categories.\n\nIf you find a few suppliers (compared to hundreds in other provinces) on Alibaba in a certain region it is almost 100% certain they are a trading company. They either buy this certain product from somewhere else to round up their product catalogue (95% in all cases) or they are really manufacturing it.\n\nBut even if they are manufacturing it in their region they are likely less attractive in terms of prices, less experienced in manufacturing this product and their raw material suppliers are also somewhere far away. Ultimately making them less competitive.\n\nThere are several reasons why you will find suppliers for a specific product settled within a province.\n\n* The infrastructure for this product is good. Meaning there are a lot of suppliers in the area supplying components for the suppliers end-product\n* The workers in this area are skilled in producing this specific product. Making it easier to manufacture the end-product. Most likely, this also improves the overall quality.\n* The province has favourable tax rates for the factory on certain products.\nNow lets look at this again. Even though you didn\u2019t know the province and where the product is mainly manufactured you can get some insights on this very easily:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Nz546Eg\n\nGuangdong province has a total of 7,766 suppliers for this product. The other provinces have only a few. So you filter by this province.\n\nNow, you are looking to buy small quantities, lets say 10 pieces to start. You can filter the supplier by MOQ now:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Ctt6PcF\n\nNow lets look at the specific suppliers. You scroll down and by hovering over the Gold supplier symbol you will see quick facts. You are basically looking for a factory that has experience in your market. This specific supplier has experience in North America, Western & Eastern Europe.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/4hP6OFi\n\n**Insider tip:**\n\nYou will want a supplier who has experience in these markets because he is probably aware of specific country requirements & regulations.\nThis helps because he may already have applied for certificates for this product that you need when importing.\n\nNow look at the product page. What does the page tell you?\n\nhttp://imgur.com/hNs5zmX\n\nYou will find the following:\n\n* Supplier has 5 year \u201cGOLD\u201d membership, which is a good sign. If he had scammed someone before Alibaba would have deleted his account and not renewed it for 5 years.\n* Price is within a reasonable range\n* Your desired MOQ can be met (10 pieces)\n* Payment terms are acceptable. I would go for PayPal at this amount.\n* The company is rather young but that doesn\u2019t matter. These type of camera\u2019s got really popular around 2012 so a company that has been in that field prior to that has actually a lot of experience.\n\n**Insider tip: The trick here is to think outside the box.**\n\nDon\u2019t only look at a supplier and try to find some issue or problem. Think about the product too. Ask yourself questions such as \u201cdoes his product portfolio make sense\u201d? Is it in line with his other products? Or as for example the last point above, \u201cwhen did these things get popular\u201d?.\n\nNow when you scroll down there are several more good indicators. For example good product photos. **You will want a supplier that can send you high-resolution photos for your packaging or private label.**\n\nhttp://imgur.com/WmRb1Um\n\nYou will see available certifications. In this case what matters are **RoHS**, **CE** & **FCC**.\n\n**RoHs** certification is necessary for most European countries & the Americas. It prohibits certain hazardous material within the product.\n**CE** is a certification for Europe to meet general standards. Its good if a supplier has this\n**FCC** is a required certification on electrical products & also a standard for the US.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/nxdQZLx\n\nYou could already feel comfortable with this supplier, but you should check further on him in person by email.\n\nNext, click on the \u201ccontact details\u201d where you will find several things that help you to evaluate the supplier further.\n\nLook at the company profile and what you can find there.\n\nAlso look at the website outside Alibaba. If you cannot find his website outside Alibaba then google his company name and try to find it that way.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/20bfi7z\n\nWhen you look at the website, pay attention on what products they manufacture. If the seller advertises cameras on Alibaba and his main products outside Alibaba are pillows then you will know they are only trading the cameras and you should look for a new supplier at this stage.\n\nBut, this supplier has mainly cameras in their assortment. Looks good so far.\n\nWhat you notice is that their address is different than the one on Alibaba. At this stage it is probably their Hong Kong office that they use to invoice their customers. Many factories in China have a company in Hong Kong for tax and banking reasons. No need to be worried at this stage.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/CR0IOH1\n\nGoing back to Alibaba, you will want to contact the supplier with your request now. You need to sign in to Alibaba to send a message.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/l9Q1Y1f\n\nBasically you want to ask for a price, MOQ, delivery time and to which customers he is selling this item too. Obviously you also need to do routine checks on factory standards, product certifications and supplier profiles. If you would order from this factory later you should also look into having an inspection by a third-party.\n\nHere is what the inquiry could look like:\n\n*Hi\u2026,*\n\n*My name is \u2026.. and I am the \u2026.(Manager/President/Buyer etc.) of \u2026. Limited/Inc.*\n\n*We are a (fill in your company\u2019s business, e.g., Importer/Buying Office/Whole seller/Online shop) and are operating in (fill in your country).*\n*You can also check out our website: www. \u2026..*\n\n*I am writing you today to inquire about a product I saw on your website/catalogue/exhibition.*\n\n*Here is a link to the product I am looking for:*\n\n*http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Wifi-Sport-Camera-Wifi-Action-Camera_1880459810.html*\n\n*Could you please give me the following information:*\n\n*Unit price based on 10 Pieces*\n*Minimum Order Quantity*\n*Available certification (CE, RoHS, FCC, GS, etc.)*\n*Production lead time*\n*Available colors*\n*Payment terms*\n*You can fill in the details in the attached quotation format or send me your quotation in the first step. Then I will evaluate your offer and get back to* *you as soon as possible.*\n\n*If you have any questions please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me.*\n\n*Thanks and best regards,*\n\nYou should now repeat this step and send an inquiry to at least 3 more companies on Alibaba.\n\nIf he didn\u2019t follow up on all your questions make sure to email him back and ask again.\n\nFor example if you need to know about certifications and they didn\u2019t reply to that, ask them.\n\n**Insider tip:**\n\nSometimes suppliers put all available certifications on Alibaba but they don\u2019t tell you that they charge extra for them. A RoHS, CE or FCC certification can cost from 200USD up.\n\nAsk to see copies of certificates.\n\n* Do the certificates match up with the article number that the supplier gave you? \u2014 > If not, ask about it\n* Is the certificate expired? \u2014 > If yes, ask if he would renew once order is placed.\n* Who issued the certificate? \u2014 > If it is a local Chinese company google them and see what you can find about their service.\n* If they don\u2019t have certificates yet, ask them if they could apply for them once you place an order.\n\nMake sure you tell them that you will not release any payments if the certificates are not available upon shipment. If you book an inspection company, make sure to instruct your inspection company to check on this.\n\nOnce you received the suppliers feedback it is time to follow up with him on samples.\n\nFor more details on how to order & test your samples properly check my other articles:\n[Here](http://importdojo.com/sample-communication-with-your-suppliers-an-in-depth-guide/)\n&\n[Here](http://importdojo.com/testing-your-samples/)\n\nOther tips for Alibaba:\n\n**AliSource Pro**\nThere is a rather new service called AliSource Pro. You can basically send quotation requests to thousands of suppliers.\n\nHere is what it looks like:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/9sgvuHo\n\nYou can input all product details and submit. Within a few hours you should have a couple of offers.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Xu1STHk\n\nThe downside to this is that there is not much filtering. Random suppliers will send you offers and some of them don\u2019t even match your inquiry. I suggest filling in as many details as possible and then going trough the whole process of filtering & scanning a supplier as described above.\n\n**Google the supplier**\n\nIf you cannot find much about the supplier on Alibaba, Google the suppliers name and see what you can find. Perhaps even try \u201csupplier name forums\u201d.\nThat way you maybe find something (positive or negative) in forums about the supplier.\n\nThese are the basics of sourcing on Alibaba, of course there is more to that. [I provide plenty of information for free on my blog](http://importdojo.com) that will get you started. There is no need to delay getting into this business, with all the tools available these days everyone can start importing from overseas and building their own brand.\n\n",

They have it good.\u201d\n\nYet every single behemoth in existence once had to court its first customer.\n\n[In this post](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/how-to-get-first-customers/), I feature some of their stories. You\u2019ll find in them a generous mix of grunt work, guts, and genius.\n\n**1 & 2: Tinder and Alibaba \u2013 physically traveled to their first users**\n\n*Tinder went from 5,000 to 15,000 users by getting sorority girls to signup on the spot*\n\nCrucial to [Tinder\u2019s success](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/how-tinder-obtained-more-than-50-million-users-through-word-of-mouth/) was then-CMO Whitney Wolfe\u2019s ideas for building an early user-base. She planned a tour that would take her to prominent college campuses around the country.\n\n- She would go to chapters of her sorority, do her presentation, and have all the girls at the meetings install the app.\n- Then she\u2019d go to the corresponding brother fraternity\u2014they\u2019d open the app and see all these cute girls they knew.\n- Tinder had fewer than 5,000 users before Wolfe made her trip. When she returned, there were some 15,000.\u201d\n\n*Alibaba \u201cbrute-forced\u201d its success by visiting factories one by one*\n\nBack in the early \u201900s,  Jack Ma sent out a large sales force to fan out across the country, visiting factories one by one to show them how they could use Alibaba and Taobao to sell stuff online.\n\nBack then, a large number of factories in China weren\u2019t used to working with other people online, and sometimes didn\u2019t even have computers or Internet.\n\nIt was hard work, but companies quickly flocked to Alibaba and its holdings. This allowed them to get an edge over eBay.\n\n**3 & 4: Quora and Reddit \u2013 seeded their sites with their own content**\n\n*Founders solved the chicken-and-egg problem by contributing the bulk of early content themselves*\n\n[Quora](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/quora-marketing-strategy/) and Reddit are two of the largest online forums in existence today, but they were once ghost towns with the chicken-and-egg problem of \u201cempty site = no users / no users = empty site\u201d.\n\nQuora co-founders D\u2019Angelo, Cheever and Cox wrote most of the earliest questions and answers themselves. The first employees and beta testers then continued this trend, until the platform generated enough activity for them to stop.\n\nReddit did the same, but it also created fake profiles. According co-founder Steve Huffman, it took several months before the front page would fill up organically without their submissions.\n\n**5 & 6: Threadless and Dropbox \u2013 the biggest believers in word-of-mouth**\n\n*Dropbox launched shared folders and a massive referral campaign*\n\nThe Dropbox empire was built on referrals.\n\n- With its massive word of mouth campaign, Dropbox grew its user base by 40 times \u2013 from 100,000 to 4,000,000.\n- In April 2010 alone, Dropbox users sent 2.8 million direct referral invites.\n- But on top of that, Dropbox itself was designed to encourage sharing. They introduced shared folders, a nifty feature that encouraged users to invite others to share access to folders.\n\n*Threadless let its community run their own initiatives*\n\nOne of Threadless\u2019 crucial early moves was to start a massive word-of-mouth campaign.\n\nFrom the get-go, [Threadless supported community](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/threadless-marketing-strategy/) initiated \u201crogue contests\u201d(spontaneous, themed tee shirt contests).\n\nIn turn, its community is insanely creative, and also fiercely loyal brand advocates.\n\n**7: Black Milk: Fashion + Fandoms = Great Success!**\n\nThe clothing store achieved its impressive growth by milking fandom for its worth. It didn\u2019t stop at making pop culture-inspired apparel \u2013 it established serious legitimacy by getting official license for all their geeky wear.\n\nIt\u2019s also made its Facebook page a fandom watering hole. Over there, dedicated \u201cSharkies\u201d can connect with like-minded fans.\n\nThere\u2019s even a Black Milk-approved group where girls can swap, buy, and sell their purchases with each other.\n\n**8: OKCupid \u2013 legendary content on OKTrends averaged 4,222 tweets per post**\n\nThe content on OKTrends was so mindblowingly insightful that people actually despaired when it was discontinued. Who wouldn\u2019t want to read and share this post titled \u201c10 Charts About Sex\u201c? (Do it, it\u2019s worth all your attention.)\n\nFrom August 2010 to April 2011, OkTrends posts averaged a staggering 32,500 Facebook likes and 4,222 tweets.\n\nCo-founder Rudder says, \u201cHonestly I think the blog\u2013one way or another\u2013has driven a lot of our growth. Certainly, it has driven brand awareness. It\u2019s been the only thing we\u2019ve ever done, other than making a great dating site, that has gotten us out there into the world.\u201d\n\n**9: Etsy \u2013 harvested interest by reaching out to target communities before launching**\n\n[Etsy founders](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/etsy-marketing-strategy/) used to run a web design shop and were working on getcrafty.com for one of their projects, during which they discovered the need for a marketplace for handmade crafts.\n\nSo, while they built Etsy, they reached out to the craft community on getcrafty.com and Craftster.org, which had an even larger user base.\n\nBy the time they launched, they already had a lot of interest generated among the two platforms, and that helped get the required inventory and start off transactions on Etsy.\n\n**10: Buffer \u2013 got to 100k users primarily through frequent guest blogging**\n\nCo-founder Leo Wildrich wrote 150 guest posts in the first 9 months of running Buffer, and he swears by it. That\u2019s 16-17 posts per month, or more than 1 every two days!\n\n\u201cRelationships are actually the most valuable things that you gain from guest posting. At the end of the day, if you do a lot of guest posting you simply make a lot of friends. I\u2019ve got great friends over at Treehouse, Social Media Examiner, SocialMouths, and other great sites. You provide someone with free content, that\u2019s a great favor if you think about it, so it\u2019s a great opportunity to make friends with these awesome people.\u201d\n\n**11: ASOS \u2013 the ecommerce store mailed its own print magazine to 400,000 customers**\n\nBack in 2006, CEO Nick Robertson insisted that the glossy print catalog was still key to making the brand an essential part of customers\u2019 lives. Today, besides maintaining a content-rich site, ASOS also has a magazine with a circulation of 456,000 \u2013 the 18th largest in the UK, immediately behind Glamour and Closer, and just a handful of places behind New.\n\nUnconditional, free shipping was irresistable.\n\nOne of the things that kept customers flocking to ASOS was its incredible shipping and returns policy \u2013 even in its early days, ASOS was shipping for free and without minimum purchase. That policy has only just recently changed, but ASOS already has a loyal fanbase worldwide.\n\n**12 & 13: Twitter and Foursquare \u2013 exploded their userbases at SXSW with guerrilla marketing**\n\n*SXSW 2007 \u2013 Twitter lived streamed the conference on huge plasma screens*\n\nCo-founder Evan Williams decided to visualize the service on 60 inch plasma screens in the hallways, because \u201cWe knew hallways were where the action was\u201d. Twitter created an event-specific feature that allowed attendees to follow a handful of \u201cambassadors\u201d.\n\nAccording to Newsweek\u2019s Steven Levy, \u201cHundreds of conference-goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters. Panelists and speakers mentioned the service, and the bloggers in attendance touted it.\u201d During the event, Twitter usage went from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000.\n\n*Foursquare \u2013 grew average check-ins from 250k to 350k with just chalk and rubber balls*\n\nFoursquare didn\u2019t have a booth like most other brands at the 2010 SXSW convention. Neither did it have Twitter\u2019s marketing budget (Twitter spent $11k on its SXSW campaign). Instead, it set up an actual game of \u201cfour square\u201d in front of the convention hall, which involved just chalk and two rubber balls.\n\nThe game drew thousands of walk-up participants [1], Said CEO Dennis Crowley, \u201cWe played all day long, and there was always a waiting line. We were handing out tee shirts, buttons, and stickers. Anytime someone didn\u2019t know what Foursquare was, we helped them find it on their phone. We helped get them up and running and using it.\u201d\n\n**14: Taskrabbit \u2013 focused on delighting moms in Boston**\n\nTaskrabbit first cornered the market with one mothers\u2019 group in Boston\n\nTaskrabbit is similar to Uber in its hyperlocal focus. Leah Busque talked about Taskrabbit\u2019s early traction in response to a question \u201cHow did you acquire your first 10,000 users?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can be tempting to just go really broad, really wide scale, really fast. But for us, we just focused on a customer segment. We focused on this mothers\u2019 group in Boston. And once we had cornered that market with that moms\u2019 group, those moms were talking to other moms on Beacon Hill and Backbay and Cambridge and it just spread from there.\u201d\n\n**15: Airbnb \u2013 shuttled from coast to coast to talk to their first users**\n\n*Founders went the extra mile for their earliest users*\n\nFounders Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk and Joe Gebbia acted on Paul Graham\u2019s advice in their Y Combinator days and \u201cdid things that didn\u2019t scale\u201d. Specifically, they went to NYC to acquire their earliest users, then followed up with them extensively.\n\n\u201cWhen New York took off, we flew back every weekend. We went door to door with cameras taking pictures of all these apartments to put them online. I lived in their living rooms. And home by home, block by block, communities started growing. And people would visit New York and bring the idea back with them to their city.\u201d \u2013 Brian Chesky, for The Atlantic\n\n\u201cBecause of the Democratic National Conventions, some people were using the site in New York and listing places. We would reach out to the very few people we had and get to know them, figure out what products they needed and what we could offer them. We tried to build loyalty knowing that if we did that, they would tell their friends. We\u2019d host parties and meetups and all sorts of different things. \n\nThrough that process, they\u2019d get very excited and tell their friends about Airbnb. It was mostly about generating as much buzz and excitement to get them to tell their friends about us.\u201d \u2013 Chesky, Startups Open-sourced\n\n*Airbnb believed in generating word-of-mouth, which would attract the press, which would generate more word-of-mouth*\n\n\u201cWe never dressed up in gorilla suits but we passed out fliers in coffee shops, train stations\u2014we did all sorts of things. I don\u2019t know what tactics worked more than others, but I think press was always the number one tactic for us. The press would spark another group of users, then we\u2019d go visit those people and talk to them and get them excited. It was a pattern that repeated itself.\u201d \u2013 Chesky, Startups Open-sourced\n\n**16: Yelp \u2013 grew a loyal user base by rewarding quality reviews**\n\n*Gave \u201cKudos\u201d for good behavior*\n\nYelp wanted to create a tight community of consistent reviewers and high quality reviews. It rightly guessed that people were more likely to write in-depth, well crafted reviews when their names appeared alongside them. So it offered special recognition to users who were first to review a business, and let other users give kudos for reviews that are useful, funny, or cool.\n\nAnd the numbers in 2006 show that most Yelp reviewers got hooked on the site:\n\nUsers who contributed 6 or more reviews:\n\nCitySearch \u2013 4.8%\nYahoo Local \u2013 11.1%\nYelp \u2013 65.8%\nUsers who left only one review:\n\nCitySearch \u2013 71.2%\nYahoo Local \u2013 56.4%\nYelp \u2013 9.2%\n\n*Treated their best \u201cElite\u201d users generously*\n\nThe most engaged Yelp users are elevated to \u201cElite\u201d status, visible by a shiny Elite badge on their account profile. By 2006, a full 44% of reviews on the site were contributed by Yelp Elite. \n\nDave Kim, a six-year Yelp Elite user with over 900 reviews, explains:\n\n\u201cYelp does a good job of finding ways to reward people, not through monetary means, but little perks \u2026 At regular Yelp Events, Elites often got first-chance to RSVP and even got in an hour before everyone else. There are specific events just for Yelp Elite that offer free food and drinks and swag.\u201d\n\n**17: Groove \u2013 reached out to the customers that \u201cgot away\u201d**\n\nCEO Alex Turnbull has written a very detailed analysis of Groove\u2019s early customer acquisition tactics, along the theme of doing things that don\u2019t scale. The tactic that stood out the most was scrapping \u2013 reaching out to customers who chose other competitors, and sincerely asking the reasons for their choice. From the exercise, Turnbull discovered and fixed several bugs, and convince customers to give Groove another chance.\n\n\n",

      "title": "I became a self made millionaire at 25 in a third world country. I will share my story here:",
      "content": "I am from Central America, a tropical region with lots of poverty and problems.\nSince I was a kid, I had the drive to put extra effort on achieving something. I started selling bananas to construction workers at 7 later selling candy to schoolmates at 10.\n\nAt 15 I decided to study business and become either an over achiever employee or a business owner, at that time I didn\u2019t exactly know which path to take.\nWhile I was in university (BA studies), I noticed I had a lot of spare time after school, so instead of wasting my time on leisure, I decided to start a business, I had no clue of which kind of business start (also to start one that didn\u2019t require much money because I had none.) I met with fellow classmates that were smart and also wanted to stand out, so together we decided to start a coffee distribution company. \n\nWe were offering coffee to restaurants and hotels but competition was very tough and we just couldn\u2019t close deals to get to break even. I started noticing the first signs of a red ocean industry and how tough it is to stand out in that kind of industry. My cofounders were not putting the same effort as I was, and that frustrated me. At a point my dorm served as the company\u2019s warehouse, packing center and distribution center, I was closing almost all of the sales with clients and also doing the delivery. I noticed many companies offered high quality coffee but only a few offered high quality tea. Also in my region (a coffee growing region) there are a lot of coffee sellers as we live in a coffee growing country. Tea was always imported from Asia and few companies actually focused on it. I noticed there was an opportunity on focusing on tea, instead of coffee. \n\nI offered my cofounders to buy their shares and they agreed (for them it was a relief) so I started sourcing tea that was grown locally and mixing it with herbs, spiced and fruits to create tasty tea blends. The product was very good and without competitors, so I went to Mcdonald\u2019s HQ and offered the product for Mccafe. Mcdonald\u2019s loved the product and agreed on the price (they also liked that I was very young). My tea processing was being done at my dorm so I lacked all the licenses required to supply at Mcdonald\u2019s standards, so I was very sincere with the Supply Chain director and told him I had all the desire but lacked the money to build the proper tea facility. I offered him teapots and with the teapot earnings I could buy the machinery and equipment required to supply them properly and also to get the sanitary approvals. He agreed on the teapots and gave me a 50% advance ($50k) for them. I bought 5,000 teapots in Alibaba (China) for $3 each and sold them at $20 to Mccafe. I used all the profits to build the facility and it took me almost one year to finally start supplying Mcdonald\u2019s.\n\n\nWhile I was already supplying them, I noticed the tea market was very small (a Blue Ocean kind, but actually a blue pond) \nMy ambitious goals (become a billionaire at 35) would be tough to reach staying exclusively in the tea industry.\nI kept hustling for two years on the tea, until an opportunity came to me (or I came to it).\n\n\nWhile I was offering tea to a sushi restaurant, out of curiosity, asked if the fish served there was locally caught.\nThe owner said; \u201cNo, it comes from Asia because local fish has bad quality and I can\u2019t risk my restaurant\u2019s reputation or client\u2019s health giving them bad quality fish.\u201d\n\nIt startled me that local restaurants didn\u2019t use local fish even though we have plenty access to both Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. Seemed like an obvious problem, so I started to find out why, what asians did right and what us, central americans did wrong.\n\nAfter months of obsessive research, the problem was lack of knowledge and investment in the local fishing industry resulting in fisherman living in poverty conditions with no ability to supply high quality fish. The solution was to teach them good practices and invest in a high quality seafood processing facility, the cost of the solution was over $400,000 in investment money that I didn\u2019t had.\n\n\nSo I decided to build a team, test out our theory and provide the product to restaurants and learn form their feedback. It was a lean start up mentality to start small and cheap to prove the business thesis. We received excellent feedback and real purchase interest from restaurants.\nThat was enough to know it was a great opportunity and also a huge market potential for growth.\nSo I decided to pitch my way up until I could secure the funds.\nAfter a year of pitching, I was far from the goal (securing $400k in a third world country is nearly impossible if you are a young entrepreneur with an idea.)\nSo I started enrolling in international entrepreneurship competitions, I was able to compete in GSEA and then Hult Prize. I didn\u2019t win them, (earned a 2nd place in both) but it was enough to broaden my network with wealthy investors with deep pockets. \n\nI secured funding early 2020 and started building the fish facility in February, the Covid lockdown hit us hard and we couldn\u2019t deliver what our investor expected.\nSo legal fights came, with lawyers I couldn\u2019t afford, while managing a born-dead company, while also pitching again to secure more funds to get us out of the hole.\nOur initial investor agreed to sell his shares if given 40% ROI, paid $150k up front and semestral payments for 5 years \n\nA new investment fund gave us a loan to pay back the previous investor and additional $300k for working capital. Very high interest rate, but at least we got a runway to prove our business through time.\n\nAfter restructuring and getting rid of internal and external bad apples, we started buying, processing and selling fish in May 2021, we closed 2021 with $2m in revenue and we will close 2022 with $10m revenue, beyond supplying fish to local restaurants we also provide fresh fish (airplane delivery) to restaurants in Miami, NY, LA, frozen fish to hotel chains all over America.\nWe have healthy debts now, a good EBITDA and a growth trajectory that will put us in $100m annual revenue in less than ten years, we will keep reinvesting profits on CAPEX and OPEX to keep up with the growth trajectory.\n\nGod has been an integral part of my journey.\n\nLessons learned:\n1. Vision and Goals must be clear.\n2. The path can change, the goals can\u2019t.\n3. Having a mission is key.\n4. Hustle, Hustle, Hustle\n5. Have a great team that compliment your strengths ad weaknesses.\n\nEdit: Some redditors don\u2019t believe this, so search for\n\u201cForbes Centroamerica Abril 2022\u201d 30 promesas de los negocios, you will see my face on the cover.\n\nNew edit:\nI will start providing proof of my story on my profile so all of you skeptics can believe, this isn\u2019t for me! It\u2019s for you!!! Human confidence and trust has brought humanity to great lengths, imagine that closed mentality was the same that kept cavemen from believing that human made fire wasn\u2019t sorcery.\n\nI hope you enjoyed my story!!!",

      "content": "I've been working with a supplier on Alibaba for over 1 year now. They are a verified factory and we do have Alibaba trade insurance on all orders. I have ordered products worth around $130k over 5 different orders in total from this supplier. On our 4th and 5th orders we recently switched to a new upgraded version of our product. Before we committed to this product we of course ordered product samples according to our specifications. We got the samples and verified them and everything was ok so we placed 2 bulk orders according to these specifications.  We finally recently received the first batch of the new products which has been sent out to a few customers now and I started noticing that the products didn't look as good as our sample products. So I ordered a few products home to myself(I'm working with a 3PL so I haven't touched the products at the warehouse). And I noticed that there is quite a big difference between the sample products we received and the actual product we got. The products have a kind of filling inside them and it seems like the sample products filling is of another material which is better than the product we bought. The weight is the same of the sample products and the actual products but the look and feel are a night and day difference between the samples and the actual products. I think the products we received are according to the order specifications but the samples we received have better material than what we ordered. So we have been tricked by them sending us better samples than what our products were supposed to be. If the samples we would have received had the same quality as the goods we got we would have not ordered these.\n\n\nWhat can we do here? Can we open a dispute for these 2 last orders or are we fucked? The problem I'm guessing is that the products we got ARE according to our specifications but the samples we received which we were told were to our specifications have better quality than our specifications. \n\n\nThe customer feedback has been quite ok on these products, we haven't gotten that many complaints but it is still not up to our standard. We want to have the best product on the market which we currently do not have due to this.\n\n\nHas anyone here been in the same situation?",

China is crazy.\n\n\n\n* China is filled with factories, most of which barely know the end product for which they make parts for. Still they are integral to the manufacturing process and will do a great job if you know how to ask them to.\n\n\n\n* Most factories are dirty, have poor/sub-par working conditions, and are located in rural districts outside the of small cities. \nhttp://imgur.com/8tVTcKS,oILFeZq (making sofas)\nhttp://imgur.com/8tVTcKS,oILFeZq#1 (coating steel frames)\nIt's not the best place for hardcore humanitarian types to visit.\n\n\n\n**FAQ**\n\n* *Should I buy from company X on Alibaba?* Probably not. It's unlikely they are the actual manufacturer. They do not have the product in stock. If you negotiate down they will find a manufacturer to lessen the quality to retain their margin. Believe it or not, factories can be very loyal, so expect a battle if you want to dump your supplier and go straight to the mfg later on. \n\n* *Should I hire a sourcing company?* If you just need one part and are not really concerned about developing more business in China, go for it. Overall, I'm not too fond of these companies. They tend to rest on the fact you don't know what you're doing. I've met sourcing experts who have never left the comforts of their major city. \n\n* *OK, so how do I source a product then?* While there isn't a silver-bullet, find someone you trust. Build a relationship over small business. Make it mutually beneficial for your company to grow. There are certainly some very motivated individuals out there.\n\n* *How do I actually import my product?* Find a freight forwarding company, preferably one that has offices near both ports. They will arrange for trucking to port, ocean freight, customs brokerage, documentation, etc. Have multiple forwarders give you line item quotes to ensure you don't get ripped off. Realistically importing a 20' container into the US will be about $2.5k-$4k (+ any import duty). \n\n",

      "title": "I\u2019m $141,000 in Debt After Chasing Big Dreams. Sometimes, it\u2019s okay to give up",
      "content": "I honestly don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I\u2019ve spent years chasing big dreams, pouring everything I had\u2014money, energy, and hope\u2014into chasing success and working towards my goals and dreams. And now I\u2019m sitting here with 8 million pesos (about $141,000) in debt, questioning everything about myself. Why do I dream so big? Why do I keep thinking I can make it? Why can\u2019t I stop?\n\nIt all started in 2019 when I opened my first physical store. I started small, renting an exhibit space to test the market, and to my surprise, it worked. I was making 50,000 pesos (around $880) a month in profit(I was selling women and kids clothing imported from China). That little success felt like validation. I thought, \u201cThis is it!\u201d So, I went all in. I took out a 1 million peso loan (about $17,650) to open a full-scale store. Renovations, stocks\u2014it all felt like the right move.\n\nAnd then COVID hit. Everything shut down, and I was forced to try online. Since I had loans to pay, I had no choice. To my surprise, the online store took off. To think that people were stuck at home, who would buy clothes for going out at a time like this. But! It was became wildly profitable\u2014more than I could have imagined. In December 2020, I hit my biggest milestone: 400,000 pesos (around $7,060) in sales in just 24 hours. I thought I had finally made it. I believed it would always be like this, that this is just the beginning and it will only get better from here.\n\nSo, I doubled down. I secured another loan to increase stock, believing that the more I had, the more I\u2019d sell(this time I was only focusing on children\u2019s clothing and shoes since that is what sold out fast). I was so optimistic, so confident. But 2021 was different. Sales slowed, and I wasn\u2019t paying attention to the numbers. I wasn\u2019t tracking my profit margins or operational costs properly. I just kept pushing forward, thinking I could turn things around if I spent more on ads. I was wrong.\n\nThe debt kept piling up. I had to shut the business down, but my family stepped in. They believed in me, and honestly, I felt like I couldn\u2019t stop. They supported me financially, encouraged me to start again. So, I took out another loan, believing that this time would be different. But it wasn\u2019t. I launched new products, and they didn\u2019t work. I shut down again. And then, because I couldn\u2019t give up, I tried again. And again. And again.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2023, my brand generated 29 million pesos (about $512,000) in sales. I spent an estimated 8 million pesos (about $141,000) on ads alone. I was able to grow my social media presence to 227k followers on facebook and 11k on instagram. I had local celebrities and influencers reaching out to me for collaboration during those times. Yet, somehow, here I am, with nothing to show for it but overwhelming debt and a heart full of regret. I have no idea where the money went. Operational costs were through the roof. At one point, I rented a warehouse for 50,000 pesos ($880) a month. I hired more employees and raised their salaries significantly because I truly believed that the success I had in December 2020 would continue forever.\n\nIt didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve shut the business down for good now. This year, I tried affiliate marketing(US based). My first month was profitable\u2014I made 60,000 pesos ($1,060). I thought, maybe this is it. Maybe I\u2019ve finally found something that works. But again, it fell apart. I ended up adding another 250,000 pesos ($4,400) to my debt(through facebook ads). Then I wrote and launched an ebook, pouring everything into it. Ads, campaigns, promotions\u2014it added another 250,000 pesos to my debt. I really thought, maybe I went through everything for this moment. I was sharing something I believed in deeply\u2014the secret supplier, the supplier of all suppliers. Profit was, of course, the first priority, but this time it felt different. I wanted to become successful while helping others achieve their success too.\n\nBut in the end, once again, it wasn\u2019t. It failed just like the rest, and the heartbreak was unbearable. I had poured my hope, my energy, and my belief into this, thinking it was finally my moment. Instead, it became another painful reminder of how far I\u2019d fallen.\n\nEvery failure has led me deeper into depression. It\u2019s heavy. So heavy. Earlier this year I took so many courses and read books on mindset. And when I tried new things, I also did it with a new mindset. And now, I\u2019m so scared to go back to the person I was before. During all those times when I was chasing success I was miserable. Stuck on survival mode that it affected how I was as a person, mom, wife, daughter and friend. At some point I\u2019m proud of the person I am now, because if I was still who I was these past years I would seriously be contemplating ending my life. And the worst part? My parents. They\u2019ve stepped in so many times, covering loans, supporting me, believing in me. They shouldn\u2019t have to. They\u2019re at an age where they should be resting, enjoying life, not worrying about their daughter\u2019s financial mess. I feel like I\u2019ve failed them spectacularly\u2014over and over again. I was supposed to retire them early, to give back after all they\u2019ve given me. Instead, I\u2019ve only added to their stress.\n\nI keep asking myself, why do I dream so big? Why can\u2019t I just accept a normal life, a stable life? Why can\u2019t I stop chasing this idea that I\u2019m meant for more? I feel like I\u2019ve been stuck in this cycle for years\u2014dreaming, failing, trying again. And now, I\u2019m at the point where I don\u2019t even know who I am without those dreams. I\u2019m tired. I feel defeated. I don\u2019t know how to move forward, but I know I can\u2019t keep going like this.\n\nTo anyone reading this: How do you let go of your dreams and accept that, no matter how deeply you knew in your heart you were meant for greatness, you\u2019re not? I\u2019m 31 years old.\n\nEDIT: \n\nI want to thank everyone who took the time and effort to comment on my post. Your empathy, insights, and advice have been incredibly valuable, and I truly appreciate the kindness and support you\u2019ve shown.\n\nFor context, I\u2019ve taken multiple courses on Facebook ads and marketing, which helped me grow my following and achieve those sales figures. My first business was actually profitable in terms of ad cost versus revenue. However, I rushed things and made decisions that weren\u2019t realistic. Looking back, if I had taken it slow, avoided loans, and been content with making 100k-300k pesos (roughly $1,800-$5,400) a day, the business might still be alive today. Unfortunately, I wanted more\u2014so I took loans, got a warehouse, and hired more employees. When sales slowed down, the loan payments piled up, and I eventually had to shut it all down last year, in 2023.\n\nThis year, I tried affiliate marketing through ClickBank (after taking another course). It was profitable at first, but like before, it eventually wasn\u2019t sustainable. I only tried two products and one MRR (Master Resell Rights) product, and while I generated significant revenue, it still wasn\u2019t enough to turn a profit overall.\n\nLastly, despite wanting to \u201cgatekeep\u201d my supplier (their value lies in being a direct Chinese platform for factories and manufacturers\u2014most sellers on Alibaba and AliExpress are just middlemen and their supplier is this supplier), my sister encouraged me to write an ebook about it since I no longer plan to sell physical products. The goal was to help others while also helping myself.\n\nMoving forward, I\u2019ve decided to focus on freelancing or virtual assistance to gain stability and work toward reducing my debt rather than adding more to it.\n\nI also want to add how grateful I am to have heard from strangers this time. It\u2019s given me a different perspective\u2014a view I couldn\u2019t see on my own.",

      "content": "Hey Reddit,  \nI am 30 years old and educated with a Business degree. After years I landed a job in one of the leading financial groups in Asia. It is great but I felt dull. Lacking of excitements, perhaps its too easy, in some aspects so ..\n\nI made a leap that some might call crazy\u2014I left my $230k job in finance to start my own sourcing company in China. It's been a whirlwind of emotions, but oddly, it feels good.   \nIn finance, my days were predictable. I had set tasks, clear goals, and a pretty good idea of what my paycheck would look like at the end of the year. It was comfortable, but somewhere along the line, it started to feel a bit too... scripted. I craved something more, something that felt like my own.  \nTransitioning to running my own business was like stepping into a different world. Suddenly, there were no clear-cut tasks at the start of each day, no guaranteed paycheck waiting for me. The uncertainty was daunting. Every decision felt like a gamble. Would this supplier be reliable? Can I ensure the quality of the products? How do I manage logistics, warehousing, and especially the nuances of communication and customization with Chinese factories?   \nBut here's the thing\u2014despite the sleepless nights and the steep learning curve, there's a part of this journey that's incredibly fulfilling. For every challenge, there's a victory. For every setback, a lesson learned. The freedom to steer my own ship, to build something from the ground up, has brought a sense of accomplishment I never found in my previous job.  \nI've come to realize that the unpredictability is not a bug; it's a feature. It's what keeps me on my toes, pushes me to innovate, and forces me to grow. And while the path of a business owner is fraught with challenges  \nHere's to the weirdly good feeling of embracing the unknown.  \n",

Are these things that can be sourced at a reasonable price in countries other than China?  \n\nAnyway, I'm sure a lot of you out there have similar products or are in a similar situation, so curious as to what your plan is.  Is it best to hire an agent (or agency) of some kind?  If businesses like this exist, how much do you think they charge?  Also, since Alibaba is mainly all Chinese suppliers, are there any alternative solutions to where you don't need to hire a middle man?  \n\nThanks for any info on this!",

      "content": "I cannot find a subreddit with over 1000 folks about sourcing.\n\nBut well, in case there isn't one, I'll list a few questions I got in mind, maybe someone will know the answer.\n\n1. I'm looking for more of a private agent than an own way to get to suppliers. A person that can hook me up with both drop for testing and private label for scaling. Where do I even start looking for one? I'm not really keen on looking for anyone on Reddit for that cuz \"my friend we're the best I provide for you cheap price fast shipping\" is not convincing to me. I know damn well a private agent will promise me a candy land, but I've had a 2 or 3 - one found on Reddit who turned out terrible despite promising whatnot. A person lurking for a client in every Reddit post doesn't seem to be reliable in the first place, but well, correct me if I'm wrong. \n2. Is there any other way than to simply start working with someone to determine credibility of that agent? \n3. Is it better to approach agents in Chinese than English? I've translated a few stores in the past few months and handled multilingual customer support, so I'm pretty used to using chat GPT for talking in other languages - and since the language barrier seems to be a problem quite often, I would be fine talking in Chinese, I think\n4. Will a good private agent won't even talk to me, if I don't have a certain MOQ? I know private agent is usually a next step, rather than getting one when the store is not even up - but when you want to sell products almost no one sells, or a variation of it that no one sells - you need to source it with ways out of reach for most people. So a product that's not available on Ali, or CJ, or wherever. I don't want to be the 12th guy selling the same neck massager, got dang it\n5. Are agencies better than private agents? I know they're more expensive, but what about performance?\n6. How did you find your agent, and how is it going? Tell me your story mate! ",

Fast forward 2 months later, I have finally recieved my stock and the logo locations are all WRONG and nothing like compared to the sample locations. Also they are not straight and aligned as per the approved samples. The supplier is trying to argue a little (overall they do seem to take blame), by saying they sent photos prior to shipping. The photos you could not really gauge the height of the logo relative to the product, my assumption is that all logos would be as per the 5 x samples i got, why would they change??  \n\n\nWhat options do I have here? This supplier is the only supplier I know that makes this product the way I like it, so I do not want our relationship to sour over this. The order does have trade assurance, but a refund and then remanufacturing all of these items seems like a huge delay, we wanted to launch this month and this has stuffed us....\n\nAny ideas?",

      "title": "AI Will Make You Extremely Rich or Kill Your Business in 2024",
      "content": "**Preface:** I'm a solo-founder in the AI space and previously worked as an ML scientist; the new advancements in AI that I'm seeing are going to impact everyone here. It doesn't matter if you're just starting out, or a bootstrapped brick and mortar founder, or even a VC backed hard tech founder. Last year was when the seeds were laid, and this is the year we'll see them bloom. There will be an onslaught of advancements that take place that are borderline inconceivable due to the nature of exponential progress. This will change every single vertical.\n\nI'm making this post because I think AI execution strategy will make or break businesses. Dramatically. Over **$50B** was put into AI startups in 2023 alone. This figure excludes the hundreds of billions poured into AI from enterprises. So, let's follow the money:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1) AI enterprise software.**\n\nThere's a lot to unpack here and this is what I\u2019m currently working on. AI enterprise software will encompass everything from hyper personalized email outbound to AI cold calls to AI that A/B tests ads on synthetic data to vertical specific software. The impact of the former is relatively self explanatory, so I'll focus on the latter. To illustrate vertical specific AI software, I'll use a simple example in the legal space. Lawyers typically have to comb through thousands of pages of documents. Now, using an LLM + a VDB, an AI can instantly answer all of those questions while surfacing the source and highlighting the specific answer in the contract/document. There are dozens of AI startups for this use case alone. This saves lawyers an immense amount of time and allows them to move faster. Firms that adopt this have a fundamental advantage over law firms that don't adopt this. This was 2023 technology. I'm seeing vertical AI software getting built by my friends in areas from construction, to real estate, to even niche areas like chimney manufacturing. This will exist everywhere. Now, this can be extrapolated much further to be applicable to systems that can do reports and even browse the Internet. This brings me to my next point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2) AI information aggregation and spread.**\n\nMy gut tells me that this will have a crescendo moment in the future with hardware advancements (*Rabbit, Tab, etc.*). You won't have to google things because it will be surfaced to you. It's predictive in nature. The people who can get information the fastest will grow their business the fastest. This part is semi-speculative, but due to the nature of LLMs being so expensive to train, I have a strong feeling that large institutions will have access to the *\\*fastest\\** and *\\*best\\** models that can do this quicker than you and I can. This is why it's important to stay on top.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3) AI content generation**\n\nThis is relevant to running advertisements and any digital marketing aspect of your business. If you can rapidly make content faster than your competitors to put in social media, you will outpace your competitors rapidly. I think most folks are familiar with MidJourney, Stable diffusion, etc. but don't know how to use it. You can generate consistent models for a clothing brand or generate images of a product that you would normally need to hire a professional photographer to take. There's also elevenlabs which is relatively easy to use and can be used to make an MP3 clip as a narration for an ad; this is something I've already done. I'm also still shocked by how many people are unfamiliar with tools like [**Pika**](https://pika.art) which can do video generation. You could imagine companies having ***fleets of digital influencers*** that they control or conjuring up the perfect ad for a specific demographic using a combination of all of the aforementioned tools.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In summary,** if you feel like I'm being hyperbolic or propagating science fiction fantasies, you're likely already behind. I truly recommend that everyone stays up to date on these advancements as much as possible. If your competitor comes across an AI tool that can increase their ROAS by 5x they can crush you. If your competitor uses a tool that increases the rate at which they receive and aggregate information by 200% (modest estimate) they will crush you. If your competitors have a tool that can reduce their employee size, then they will use it. They'll fire their employees to cut costs and reinvest the money back into their business. It will compound to the point where you're outpaced, and this isn't a level of innovation we've seen since the birth of the industrial revolution. Your customers can get stolen overnight, or you can steal your competition\u2019s customers overnight.\n\n**TL;DR:** This is an opportunity for entrepreneurs to scale faster than they could have possibly imagined, but this also comes with the potential for your company to be obliterated. We've never seen advancements that can have this drastic of an impact this quickly. Adoption will happen fast, and first movers will have a disproportionate and compounding advantage. Watch guides, meet with startups, follow the news, and get rich.",

Answer: See Green Industrial Co LTD\n* Who are See Green Industrial Co's top customers? #1 Lululemon, #2 Gaiam & #3 Fit For Life\n\nI created ImportYeti because these bill of ladings are public information and nearly every large eCom owner or FBA seller I know uses expensive alternatives to ImportYeti that are too cost prohibitive for the small guys starting out.\n\nIt would be my  hope that people don't use this to \"copy\" competitor  products. There are already enough product clones floating around the internet. Rather, I'd love to help people understand which factories to use versus just blasting out e-mails on Alibaba, trying to intelligently decide which  factories to visit, walking into a trade show blind or relying solely on connections with your existing factories.\n\n**It  is still in a super rough beta state. I've only invested a handful of  hours and am interested in understanding if this tool is actually  helpful and what direction I should take it in. I only want to create  something if people really love it.**\n\nIf  you're interested in beta testing the tool, please comment below or  send me a PM.

      "title": "How I've been making over 10k / mon. since 20 (25 now)",
      "content": "Want to give some value, in particular for the younger guys, as I know how the online entrepreneur space is these days. SMMA, dropshipping, crypto, lambos, Miami, Dubai, I know what it's like to see that stuff all over the internet. All of these gurus, infoproduct guys, etc. etc. \n\nMy average month is about 20k-30k now, I do real life business, I didn't just hit it once, It has been consistent. I had a clothing brand agency, well still do, and my biggest month was about 25k Rev, but the majority of money I've made was in sales. I've tried dropshipping, SMMA, Crypto, all of it. My first sales job was as a door to door canvasser, setting free roof inspections for a roofing company at 19. I didn't want to do it, I had too much pride, always told myself I'd run my own company, be a millionaire before everyone else. I was the only kid my age at the time into self improvement, going to seminars, Tony Robbins, Gary Vee, etc. but I didn't have the vehicle to make my first money yet. I eventually lost my job, car got totaled, I was late on rent, no source of transportation and this offer came up. Long story short, I did it and made my rent that first week, which was $1,000 at the time (2018). The sales guys that were closing all made over $100k. Before you make a million, you need to surpass six figures. \n\nNow I'll get deeper into the specific industry I'm in but I want to highlight D2D, and sales in general as it relates to entrepreneurs. The entrepreneurial spirit is something some of us are born and gifted with. It is only a matter of time before you find the vehicle to express that. Entrepreneurship is a sport to a degree, but it's a mental one, not physical. There are skillsets involved, like in sports. A fighter will train to enhance his skills, speed, power, cardio, different fighting styles, boxing, BJJ, etc. I say this because as an entrepreneur, your ability to succeed depends on your strengths and weaknesses, and building your strengths is only a matter of putting in reps. No course or PDF will put reps in for you. You need to train and persistently put in those reps to enhance those skills that translate into desired outcomes and results. This is where sales comes in. D2D is unlimited entrepreneurship training, and the best part is you get paid to learn. If you started a business from scratch right now, with no experience, you'd need to sell one of two things, a product, or a service. Now in the creation of that product or service, there are skillsets involved in doing so, you have to build those, and if you want to succeed at them, you have to get good as well. In sales, its one primary skill, you're selling someone else's product or service, so you don't have to worry about the fulfillment or management of that business. Sales and marketing drive revenue simply speaking. If you can sell and market, you can profit. Where many young people, myself included, go wrong, is they hear about these business models that these guys teach, and try to manage a business that they know nothing about. They tell you how they made $10k, $100k per month. And give you a blue print of what they're doing, but you didn't put in the reps they did. If LeBron put out a course on how to shoot better, I imagine there's some value in that, but you aren't putting in LeBrons work, and with his natural gifts, so you're not going to become him. Lock in on whats in front of you and progress by mastering one thing, then learning the next skillset you know you'll need to learn on the trajectory to become a master CEO. This is the way, not chasing online trends. FB ads changes, Tik Tik changes, Instagram changes, markets get saturated. Build you. \n\nNow what is the industry I'm in? Exterior home restoration. What is that? Well basically we complete work on homes from storm damage, hail, winds, tornadoes, hurricanes, etc. and insurance pays for the work. Every home owner has insurance, and these companies pay for repairs to be completed. Like an auto body shop, if you crash a car, or got hail damage, the company pays the shop, shop does the work, and boom everyone's happy. I started setting leads, went on to closing deals, then later started project managing. Roofing was the bread and butter, but I've made the most of money so far doing niche high end windows that get damaged by hail. These windows are 5x the cost of a roof, and most contractors have no clue how to deal with the claims and install. I have an LLC and subcontracted by the contractors to generate deals. I close the deals, they complete the work. This is my business, and it works well. I get a $5k avg. per deal, and I sell a lot. If you're interested in learning more about this specific industry fire away questions or DM me, I'm more than happy to help. ",

      "title": "What I learnt from sourcing e-commerce products from China.",
      "content": "DISCLAIMER: The intention of this to increase cautiousness and practice best practices between the entrepreneurs that are importing from China. \n\nSo I have been running an e-commerce store for a very long time, not a drop-shipping particularly but we would order the products in bulk to the country and then ship from there (For faster shipping).I wanted to do drop-shipping but then it halted back in 2019, right after the COVID and ePacket was banned >!(ePacket is a shipping agreement between US and China to reduce shipping times, it uses passenger planes to carry the parcel, hence faster shipping)!<.\n\nAnyway getting back to the point, We were selling jewellery in the United States, firstly we used to just order from Aliexpress (a bunch of 500 every week) to our warehouse, do the quality check and then we would ship it from there. However the price per item was $7.80 and it was selling for $25.99 with a good profit margin.\n\nWe decided to scale that store (I shared the scaling strategy in a different blog post) by going to a supplier and ordering 10K since Q4 was coming up and we were trying to scale up, the item was selling like a hot dog. We posted a few Request For Quotation on Alibaba and got some quotations and here are my learnings.\n\n* **You will get the same product for less.**\n\nThe item we were getting for $7.80 was available for as low as $4.00 if we ordered in bulk, and as high as $10, so it varies. If you order $10K units then it will be available for $2.00. The more volume you ask for the lesser the cost will be - I mean it's normal, but the cost can go very low. I mean compare $7.80 to $2.00\n\n* **You will have to do your own quality check.**\n\nAlibaba is not like Amazon where they do the quality check for you, you will have to do your quality check before you ship the items to your customers. We ordered 10K and got around 300 defective items from the supply. (either they were broken, or of a bad quality). And then you have to send them to the supplier, the supplier will usually ask you to send the items back but it's not worth the time. So make sure that you order at least 10% more of what you need.\n\n* **Plan your shipments accordingly and choose the correct method**\n\nUnrelated to the store, we saw a great kitchen product that we thought could do really good in the American market, but the problem? It was 1.2Kgs. It was a really large item made out of stainless steel. We wanted it faster but AIR CARGO was expensive (it was charging $2000) as we did not have time since Q4 was already around the corner, however the affordable option was ship containers but the transit time was 1 month. So make sure if you plan to order large items, do it beforehand and make sure you choose the right shipping service to save costs.\n\n* **Trust your negotiation skills.**\n\nYou got to trust your negotiations skills and don't be shy when negotiating with your suppliers, we got down the per product cost from $6 to $4.80. While it may not seem a lot but it saved around $3500 per order. So negotiation works! I mean just like any other business.\n\n* **Never ditch a supplier too early.**\n\nIf you find a better price somewhere then don't move your orders at once, we got a supplier that was giving the exact same product for almost 20% less, and ordered 500 units from them. Most of the units were defective, so always maintain multiple suppliers until you do the quality check of both of the suppliers.\n\n* **Have multiple modes of communication**\n\nIf you're using Alibaba chat to communicate with your suppliers then make sure you have their emails and WhatsApp, WeChat or anything they use because they will go offline without prior notice.\n\n* **You will get free FedEX/UPS shipping**\n\nDon't hesitate to ask for premium shipping if you maintain a good relationship, the supplier we had used to send the items using ePacket which used to take 10-14 days, talked to the supplier and he offered a premium FedEX shipping for large orders which delivered the order in 4-5 days max (to California)\n\n* **Always use AliBaba Payment Gateway**\n\nNever use PayPal, or WeChat or anything else to send the funds, it's just not worth the hassle. Even though you have the escrow services at place. I would just avoid PayPal or anything and just go with Alibaba's gateway. It is seamless and has a great grievance redressal system.\n\n* **Product Sourcing Agents are great but be careful**\n\nThere are a lot of product sourcing agents are great, they will get in touch directly with the manufacturer for you and can get any type of customisation done for you and can get you better prices. But be careful and use a better sourcing agent.\n\nI guess that was it. I will edit this post if I find more points to address.",

Lately, I\u2019ve become really curious about international trade, especially how small businesses in the US manage to import products from China.\n\n\n\nA bit of context: many of my friends from high school and college (some still in China) are running \u201cinternational trade\u201d businesses. To be honest, it\u2019s quite surprising to me, because most of them don\u2019t speak much English or have any background in manufacturing or supply chains. From what I\u2019ve gathered, they mostly find local Chinese products and resell them via platforms like Alibaba and Amazon.\n\n\n\nThis got me thinking\u2014how do small businesses based in the US (who are far from the source) handle product quality, customs, and communication with suppliers? Big companies have teams, lawyers, and huge purchase volumes to leverage, but small businesses seem to face more uncertainty and risk in cross-border trade.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re a small business owner or have experience sourcing from China, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. How do you make it work? Do you use sourcing agents? How do you manage quality control remotely? Any insights or stories would be greatly appreciated.",

You can answer questions like:\n\n* **Who makes Bass Pro Shop's 4 Burner Gas Griddle?** Answer: NINGBO HUIGE OUTDOOR PRODUCTS\n* I thinking of buying barbells from a company I found on Alibaba called Nantong Leeton Fitness Co., the #1 ranking company on Alibaba for the term \"barbell\". **Is Nantong Leeton Fitness Co. the right supplier?** Answer: No. They are a big company but primarily sell resistance bands & foam rollers. They are likely outsourcing their heavy metal work creating a more costly product for you and you're more likely to have quality issues as well.\n* **Who are the top companies & suppliers who import/export under HS Code 42.02.92 -- trunks & suitcases?**\n* **Who are the top companies & suppliers who import/export under HS Code 42.02.92 out of Indonesia?**\n\nI want to thank the 600+ redditors from r/Entrepreneur who gave feedback on ImportYeti. It made a crazy difference. It really helped me understand how people actually use the tool and what needed to change about it. I added every major(but still possible) request that was mentioned during our closed beta test including hs-code/hts-code functionality(I'm really interested in feedback on this in particular), various search filters, address search (so you can try to find companies importing under different names), did multiple passes de-duping the company names (still needs some work, but a lot better), completely rewrote our search algorithm and fixed 100+ bugs & usability issues.\n\n**Even though I'm allowing puiblc access this time, I'd still love any and all feedback (love or hate)... no matter how brutal : ) I only want to create things that people really love. If you enjoyed this tool, have any ideas for how to improve it, or found a bug/usability issue, I want to hear from you. Please PM me or comment below anytime**",

For instance, as we improved color deviation detection, operators have become less vigilant in monitoring the printing machines. Similarly, with the advancement of damage detection capabilities, there is a growing tendency to continue production while tolerating a higher rate of defects, with the expectation that the camera system will catch and reject them. Since we can not reach 100% rejection of all defects this is a recurring source of problems. Lastly, as we have enhanced decoration defect detection, there has been a noticeable decline in the rigor of visual inspections. This complacency eventually leads to significant incidents, accompanied by a big show of concerns and complaints regarding the camera systems i manage.\n\n I would greatly appreciate guidance and insights on how to effectively address this challenge. Specifically, I am interested in strategies and best practices that can help strike a better balance between improving the camera inspection systems and maintaining the highest standards of product quality, without inadvertently encouraging operator complacency.\n\nThank you in advance for your time and consideration.

This is a new industry to me so I'm still learning a lot, but in trying to find a manufacturer, to me it would make the most sense to manufacture in Mexico, where labour will be cheaper than Canada/US, you're shipping across a continent instead of continent + ocean, and because of the Free Trade Agreement, it appears there would be no duty on it (other countries would tack on 18% duty). Am I missing anything here?   \n\n\nNow the issue I've been having is actually finding a manufacturer in Mexico who can make bras, and ideally offers full package manufacturing. I've contacted the few I've found, but have yet to hear back. What am I doing wrong? Do I need a sourcing agent? I've heard that Mexico doesn't work the same way as Asia for hiring sourcing agents.   \n\n\nOr do I scrap Mexico and just go with either an Asian manufacturer or a domestic one until I have enough volume? Thank you very much for any pointers.",

The project itself is a number of parts that connect to a bluetooth keyboard I source from a different factory. My hope would be that I can ship the keyboards to the molding factory and have them assemble and box the units.\n\nHow do people typically manage projects like this? Do you talk with the factory about the project and get them up to speed on what the project is and how it needs to be assembled? I imagine, with manufacturing, there's a lot of little details the factory has to change to make a functional product. How do you ensure everything will fit together correctly when the molds are completed? From what I understand, molding companies generally offer assembly services as they can offer lower prices due to not having to ship parts to anyone. Assuming this is correct, is it typical for the molding company to become the central manager of the product?\n\nWe used an agency in the past but are trying to move away from them. In the past they filled in these gaps but we have enough engineering knowhow that we think we can cut them out and still create an effective product.\n\nThanks",

      "content": "I have a commercial product in development after several successful deployments of prototypes on little sports broadcast projects like FIFA World Cups and the NFL Super Bowl. The updated engineering drawings for the main component molds are nearing completion. Drawings for a few supporting molded products will be complete soon. All drawings are in Solidworks by someone who does that for a living, and isn't me. And I expect that a good mold maker/manufacturer will have required and suggested modifications to the work we\u2019ve done so far. I'm curious if there is one point of manufacture for these varied components in the Ohio valley or upper Midwest.\n\nMain product:\n\nI'm looking for an injection mold maker and manufacturer for five (5) HDPE components that are similar to products currently on the plastic pallet market. Each piece is roughly 30\"x40\"x6\". I'm looking for a closed cell type of HDPE that is almost like a structural foam. Similar to ULine's Heavy duty nestable pallets and storage bins.\n\nSupporting products:\n\nPart A: Small rubber silicone rings approximately 3.5\" ID and 1/2\" thick, so 4\" OD. I feel like this should be relatively easy to source, but I\u2019d like to understand if it's possible to purposefully achieve different elastomeric properties from rings with the same dimensions. In an ideal scenario I'd like the ability to model the deflection properties of the different rings and their elastomeric values as a shock absorber for different loads and velocities. Good stuff to know about one's product, but in the end is probably just eye candy for customers.\n\nPart B: HDPE with carbon fiber additive for married bracket pair. Approximately, the married pair is 3/4\"x3/4\"x12\" when joined. I would like to consider getting 4 married pairs per molding, so 8 cavities. Probably also safe to consider using the same closed cell HDPE material referenced in the main product as an alternative to my suggestion for HDPE with a carbon fiber additive.\n\n  \nFor context, I can see the outcome clearly in my mind's eye but I work with power, transmission, communications, and on-air technical systems in my day job. I have no personal manufacturing or mold making experience to draw from. The finished product is intended for data center and military deployments as well as the broadcast, AV, trade show, and data center co-lo markets. The whole product systems and these supporting molded products (and others components in this project) are currently housed under 4 pending patents, and PCTs.\n\nI\u2019m posting this in r/manufacturing and r/InjectionMolding for thoughts, advice, solicitation of services in the Ohio valley and upper Midwest.

      "content": "Apologies for the long post, but I've tried to include as much detail as possible.\n\nI'm prototyping a product made out of aluminum extrusion profile, and have some questions about buying in bulk.  The profile requirements are pretty simple:\n\n* 2020 (20mm x 20mm) square\n* 4 t-slots\n* Black anodized (I can't use silver, so black anodized is a must)\n\nI priced and sourced enough profile for my prototypes from typical online sources in the US like Misumi, 8020, etc.  I also had the vendor do the cutting and machining (end tapping and access hole drilling) but if I start producing this product for real, I'll do the cutting and machining myself.\n\nThe retail price I paid is way too high to make producing a real product feasible, but I expected that.  I'm trying to do some back-of-the-napkin math on how much of a cost savings I could expect by buying in bulk, and would really appreciate any data from people who buy these kinds of profiles in bulk.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. I configured a 1220mm (approximately 8 feet) length from one of the vendors and it was about $18.50.  If I buy these in bulk, is there a rough estimate on what I could expect to pay?  Half, 2/3, 1/4, etc?  I would strongly prefer to buy from a local supplier (I'm in Colorado) instead of importing from overseas.\n2. Is the profile I mentioned considered a standard profile that most aluminum extrusion suppliers would already have a die for, or would I have to pay for a die just for me to use?\n3. When buying in bulk, are these kinds of profiles typically sold by the foot, the ton, etc?\n4. Is there a standard length such as 4 foot, 8 foot, etc?\n5. Surface imperfections like scratches, etc, would be unacceptable in the finished product, especially with it being black anodized.  Do most suppliers have the ability to wrap them or otherwise protect them against scratches during shipment?\n6. How are bulk profiles normally prepared for shipment?  I'm assuming they would be put on pallets?\n7. I would prefer to buy from a local supplier and pick them up using a cargo van service, or buy my own cargo van.  That will limit the maximum length to about 8 feet, and the total weight to anywhere from 2 to 4 tons.  I can't use a vehicle larger than that, because I would start producing these as a home based business to get started, and the maximum size vehicle I can get in and out of my property would be a cargo van.  If the product takes off and I need to scale, I'd then look into leasing an industrial space and might be able to accept larger shipments.\n\nI know these are a lot of questions, and my next step should be to start visiting local suppliers and talk with them.  I'm just looking to get some real-life info from people who buy these in bulk, so when I go talk to suppliers I don't sound like a complete dummy.\n\nAny info or advice would be greatly appreciated - thanks!",

The department consists of a \u2018quality manager\u2019 and two techs. I need some advice on how to improve this department. The manager is very stubborn, and I am sure will be  resistant to any change. She also wants a large list of unrealistic qualifications for new employees while paying minimum wage. \n\nIt is not really my job to improve the quality department, I have no control over them, but i need to do something because they are causing delays with all of the projects my name is on, making me look bad to our customers\nAny advice or tips would be great ",
