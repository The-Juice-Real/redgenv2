# Service Type Analysis Report

## CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. SOURCING SERVICES vs CHINA SOURCING
**Problem**: Massive duplication - both have identical 47 subreddits and overlapping search terms
**Impact**: Wastes resources, confuses users, dilutes search effectiveness
**Fix**: Consolidate into specialized categories

### 2. SOCIAL MEDIA vs SOCIAL MEDIA POSTING  
**Problem**: Two nearly identical services with different subreddit counts (7 vs 47)
**Impact**: Inconsistent user experience, unclear differentiation
**Fix**: Merge or clearly differentiate purposes

### 3. INCONSISTENT SUBREDDIT QUALITY
**Problem**: Mix of active/inactive subreddits, some are private/banned
**Impact**: Search failures, poor lead quality
**Fix**: Validate all subreddits for activity and accessibility

### 4. GENERIC SEARCH TERMS
**Problem**: Terms like "need help" are too broad and low-intent
**Impact**: Poor lead quality, high noise-to-signal ratio
**Fix**: Use specific, high-intent search terms

### 5. MISSING SEASONAL/TREND AWARENESS
**Problem**: No adaptation for seasonal demands or trending topics
**Impact**: Misses time-sensitive opportunities
**Fix**: Add dynamic trend integration

### 6. SCORING BIAS TOWARD MANUFACTURING
